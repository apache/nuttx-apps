5.19 2011-03-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Initial version of the apps/ directory was released as contributed by
	  Uros Platise.

6.0 2011-03-21 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* README.txt -- README cosmetics
	* hello/ -- hello world minor changes
	* Makefile -- Makefile cosmetics (I am slowly adding the Darjeeling JVM)
	* Make.defs -- New file adds common make definitions for applications.
	* hello/Makefile -- Now uses new Make.defs definitions.  Added README.txt.
	* apps/poweroff -- New application to turn off board power.
	* Moved NSH library, netutils, and examples from the nuttx/ directory to
	  the apps/ directory
	* Moved exec_nuttapp machinery into the nuttapp/ directory.

6.1 2011-04-10 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Creation of auto-generated header files now occurs during the context
	  build phase.
	* Added sdcard insert and eject, nsh command '?' and some code remarks
	* Renamed nuttapp to namedapp
	* namedapp/binfs.c -- Create a tiny filesystem that can be used
	  to show the internal named apps under /bin.
	* Numerous fixes to build system required to support building with native
	  Windows toolchain.

6.2 2011-05-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nxffs:  Add a test a a configuration that will be used to
	  verify NXFFS.

6.3 2011-05-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/interpreter: Add a directory to hold interpreters.  The Pascal add-
	  on module now installs and builds under this directory.
	* apps/interpreter/ficl: Added logic to build Ficl (the "Forth Inspired
	  Command Language").  See http://ficl.sourceforge.net/.
	* apps/netutils/dhcpc, dhcpcd, and tftp.  If these directories are included
	  in the configuration but CONFIG_NET_UDP is disable (which is not very wise),
	  then a make error occurs because tools/mkdep.sh is called with no files.
	* system/free: Move Uros' custom free command from vsn/free
	* system/install: Add a new install command submitted by Uros Platise.
	* examples/rgmp.  Add a placeholder for an RGMP build example.
	  RGMP is a project for running GPOS and RTOS simultaneously on
	  multi-processor platforms. See http://rgmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
	  for further information about RGMP.  NOTE:  This is an empty example
	  on initial check-in.

6.4 2011-06-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c: If a network device name and IP address are provided
	  with the ifconfig command, then this command will now set the network address.
	  (Contributed by Yu Qiang).
	* netutils/ftpc: A library to support client-side FTP.
	* examples/ftpc: A simple add-on to the NSH.  From NSH, you can start
	  this simple FTP shell to transfer files to/from a remote FTP server.

6.5 2011-06-21 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* netutils/ftpc:  Simpflication and size reduction.

6.6 2011-07-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Make.defs, namedapp/namedapp.c: Several structural changes made to get a
	  clean compile under the ez80 ZDS-II toolchain (no design changes).
	* apps/examples/buttons: Add a test for the new standardized button interfaces
	* apps/examples/nxtext: Add another NX graphics test.  This one focus on
	  placing text on the background while pop-up windows occur.  Text should
	  continue to update normally with or without the popup windows present.

6.7 2011-08-02 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nx and nxtext:  These examples can now be built as NSH
	  "built-in" commands.
	* apps/examples/nxhello:  The simplest graphics example:  It just says
	  "Hello, World!" in the center of the display. This example can also be
	  built as an NSH "built-in" command.
	* apps/examples/nx, ntext, and nxhello:  All updated to use the new
	  NuttX font interfaces.
	* apps/examples/nximage:  Another super simple  graphics example:  It just puts
	  the NuttX logo in the center of the display. This example can also be
	  built as an NSH "built-in" command.
	* apps/examples/usbstorage: Can now be built as two NSH "built-in" commands:
	  'msconn' will connect the USB mass storage device; 'msdis' will disconnect
	  the USB storage device.
	* apps/examples/nx*:  All NX header files moved from nuttx/include/nuttx to
	  nuttx/include/nuttx/nx.
	* apps/examples/usbstorage: Added instrumentation to monitor memory usage
	  to check for memory leaks in the USB storage driver.
	* apps/examples/nxhello/nxhello_bkgd.c:  Fix handling of allocated glyph
	  memory.

6.8 2011-08-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nxlines:  Added a test for NX line drawing capabilities.

6.9 2011-09-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nxlines:  Extend the line drawing text to include drawing
	  of circles.
	* apps/system/i2c:  Add an I2C test tool that should help to bring up I2C
	  devices (when it is fully functional).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_timcmds.c:  Add the date command that can be used to
	  show or set the time (only if CONFIG_RTC is set).

6.10 2011-10-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/i2c:  Add repitition and address auto-incrementing so that
	  and command can be executed numerous times.  Add a new verify command
	  that will write to a register, read from register, and verify that
	  returned value.
	* apps/graphics/tiff:  Add a library that can be used to create TIFF files.
	* apps/examples/tiff:  Add a unit test for the TIFF file creation logic
	* apps/examples/lcdrw:  Add a test to verify if you can or can or read
	  data from an LCD correctly.
	* apps/examples/usbterm:  A USB terminal example.. more of a USB chat or
	  serial bridge:  Data received on local console echoed via USB serial;
	  data received on USB serial is echoed on the local console.
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  Add a simple, generic test for any
	  touschscreen driver.
	* Makefile:  The apps/ Makefile now checks for an apps/external directory
	  or symbolic link.  If such a directory/link exists (and has a Makefile),
	  it will be added to the apps/ build.  This allows external directories
	  to be included into the apps/ build by simply creating a symbolic link.

6.11 2011-11-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	(No major changes from 6.10)

6.12 2011-12-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/buttons:  The button test can now be executed as an NSH
	  built in command.

6.13 2012-12-26 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/dhcpd: May now be built as an NSH built-in application
	  by setting CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS.
	* apps/netutils/dhcpd/dhcpd.c: Fix several problems using host order address
	  where network addresses expected (and vice versa).
	* apps/examples/nettest: May now be built as an NSH built-in application
	  by setting CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS.
	* apps/examples/nettest: Correct some build issues with the nettest is
	  built for performance evaluation.
	* apps/examples/adc:  Add a very simple test to drive and test an ADC
	  driver.
	* apps/examples/pwm:  Add an NSH PWM command to drive and test a PWM
	  driver.
	* apps/examples/can:  Add an NSH CAN command to drive and test a CAN
	  driver in loopback mode.

6.14 2012-01-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/buttons/main.c:  The test needs to call up_buttoninit() to
	  properly configure the button interrupt GPIOs.
	* apps/examples/pwm:  Add support to test the pulse count option recently
	  added to the PWM interface.

6.15 2012-02-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/nsh_serial.c and nsh_usbdev.c:  If NuttX is configured to use
	  a USB serial console, then NSH needs to wait until the USB console is
	  connected and available.
	* apps/examples/composite:  Add a test of the USB composite device.
	* apps/examples/Telnetd:  Move the tiny uIP shell example from
	  netutils/Telnetd to examples/Telnetd.  Enhanced the Telnetd daemon so that
	  it supports Telnetd via a TTY device driver: A new TTY device driver is
	  created when each new Telnet connection is created.  The shell thread
	  is started with stdin, stdout, and stderr mapped to the TTY device.
	* netutils/Telnetd:  The old uIP Telnet demo is gone.  In its place is a new
	  Telnet infrastructure. The new Telnet daemon creates sessions that are
	  "wrapped" as character devices and mapped to stdin, stdout, and stderr.
	  Now the Telnet session can be inherited by spawned tasks.
	* examples/Telnetd:  Add a test for the new Telnet daemon.
	* examples/Telnetd/telnetd_driver.c: Move the internal socket structure from
	  the daemon's socket array into the driver's state data so that it will be
	  independent from the Telnetd daemon.
	* apps/system/readline:  Moved the old nuttx/lib/stdio/lib_fgets.c here
	  and renamed it as readline().  The old fgets was simplied and the overloaded
	  readline functionality was removed.
	* apps/netutils/ftpd:  Add an FTPD server (does not even compile on initial
	  checkin).
	* apps/examples/ftpd:  Add a test for the FTPD server (untest on initial
	  check-in).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add support for a 'dmesg' command that will
	  dump the system log if CONFIG_SYSLOG is selected.

6.16 2012-03-10 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/qencoder:  Add a quadrature driver test.
	* apps/examples/ostest/fpu.c:  Add a test to verify that FPU registers
	  are properly saved and restored on context switches.
	* apps/system/readline/readline.c:  readline() will now treat either a
	  backspace or a DEL character as a backspace (i.e., deleting the character
	  to the left of the cursor).  This makes NSH less dependent on particular
	  keyboard mappings of the Backspace key.  Submitted by Mike Smith.
	* apps/system/cdcacm:  An example that illustrates how the CDC/ACM driver
	  may to connected and disconnected through software control.
	* apps/examples/nsh/nsh_main.c:  If available, call up_cxxinitialize() to
	  initialize all statically defined C++ classes.
	* apps/nshlib:  Now supports a USB serial device for NSH console I/O.  This
	  allows NSH to be used on boards that have USB but no serial connectors.

6.17 2012-04-14 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/can:  Add conditional compilation so that the test can be
	  configured to only send messages or to only receive messages.  This will
	  let the test work in other modes than simple loopback testing.
	* apps/examples/hello and apps/examples/ostest:  Can now be built as NSH
	  built-int functions.
	* vsn/hello:  Removed.  The modified apps/examples/hello is enough "Hello,
	  World!"
	* apps/examples/nxconsole:  Add a test of the NX console device.
	* apps/examples/nxconsole:  The NX console example now supports running
	  the NuttShell (NSH) within an NX window.
	* apps/system/readline:  Now uses standard definitions from
	  include/nuttx/ascii.h and vt100.h
	* Kconfig, */Kconfig:  Added skeleton Kconfig files to all directories that
	  may need them.

6.18 2012-05-19 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Kconfig:  Continued Kconfig file updates (no longer tracking on a per-file
	  basis in the ChangeLog)
	* apps/examples/watchdog:  Add a watchdog timer example.
	* apps/examples/tiff:  Fix wrong path used for temporary file.
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  Standardize the board-specific, touchscreen
	  initialization interfaces.

6.19 2012-06-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbdev.c:  Add the capability to use an arbitrary USB
	  device as the console (not necessarily /dev/console).  This is a useful
	  option because then you can still use the serial console to debug with.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbdev.c:  User now has to press ENTER 3 times before
	  USB console will start.  Otherwise, the USB console starts before there
	  is anyone at the other end to listen.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbdev.c and nsh_consolemain.c:  Add support for the USB
	  capability when a USB console is used.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add the 'mv' command

6.20 2012-07-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* namedapp/exec_namedapp.c - Correct an error when round robin scheduling
	  is enabled.  The priority of the new, named application was erroneously
	  being set to the priority of the parent thread; losing its configured
	  priority.  Reported by Mike Smith.

6.21 2012-08-25 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/include/: Stylistic clean-up of all header files.
	* apps/modbus and apps/include/modbus:  A port of freemodbus-v1.5.0
	  has been added to the NuttX apps/ source tree.
	* apps/examples/modbus:  A port of the freemodbus-v1.5.0 "demo"
	  program that will be used to verify the FreeModBus port
	* apps/modbus:  Don't use strerror().  It is just too big.
	* apps/modbus:  Add CONFIG_MB_TERMIOS.  If the driver doesn't support
	  termios ioctls, then don't bother trying to configure the baud, parity
	  etc.
	* apps/nshlib:  If waitpid() is supported, then NSH now catches the
	  return value from spawned applications (provided by Mike Smith)
	* apps/nshlib:  Lock the scheduler while starting built-in applications
	  in order to eliminate race conditions (also from Mike Smith).
	* apps/examples/adc, pwm, and qencoder:  Add support for testing
	  devices with multiple ADC, PWM, and QE devices.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c:  Separated mount-related commands out of
	  nsh_fscmds.c.  Extended to the mount command so that if no arguments
	  are provided, then the current mountpoints are enumerated.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c:  Add an NSH df command to list the
	  properties of mounted file systems.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Extend help command options.  'help' with
	  no arguments outputs a short list of commands.  With -v lists all
	  command line details.  A command name can be added to just get
	  help on one command.
	* system/readline.c:  If character input/output is interrupted by a
	  signal, then readline() will try the read/write again.
	* apps/*/Make.defs:  Numerous fixes needed to use the automated
	  configuration (from Richard Cochran).

6.22 2012-09-29 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/netutils/thttpd/thttpd_cgi.c:  Missing NULL in argv[]
	  list (contributed by Kate).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c: CONFIG_NSH_DISABLE_WGET not CONFIG_NSH_DISABLE_GET
	  in one location (found by Kate).
	* apps/examples/ostest/prioinherit.c:  Limit the number of test
	  threads to no more than 3 of each priority.  Bad things happen
	  when the existing logic tried to created several hundred test
	  treads!
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h:  Both CONFIG_LIBC_STRERROR and CONFIG_NSH_STRERROR
	  must be defined to use strerror() with NSH.
	* apps/examples/*/*_main.c, system/i2c/i2c_main.c, and others:  Added
	  configuration variable CONFIG_USER_ENTRYPOINT that may be used to change
	  the default entry from user_start to some other symbol.  Contributed by
	  Kate.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd/c:  Fix a typo that as introduced in
	  version r4402:  'lese' instead of 'else' (Noted by Max Holtzberg).
	* tools/mkfsdata.pl: The uIP web server CGI image making perl script was
	  moved from apps/netutils/webserver/makefsdata to nuttx/tools/mkfsdata.pl
	  (Part of a larger change submitted by Max Holtzberg).
	* apps/netutils/webserver, apps/examples/uip, and apps/include/netutils/httpd.h:
	  The "canned" version of the uIP web servers content that was at
	  netutils/webserver/httpd_fsdata.c has been replaced with a dynamically
	  built configuration located at apps/examples/uip (Contributed by
	  Max Holtzberg).
	* apps/netutils/webserver:  Several inenhancements from Kate including the
	  ability to elide scripting and SERVER headers and the ability to map
	  files into memory before transferring them.
	* apps/netutils/webserver:  Add ability to map a URL to CGI function.
	  Contributed by Kate.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c: The changes of 6.21 introduced holes in the
	  error handling:  Now the number of arguments to mount can be 0 or 4.
	  Additional parameter checking is required to prevent mysterious errors
	  (submiteed by Kate).
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd_mmap.c:  Fix errors when the mmap()
	  length is zero (submitted by Kate).
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd_sendfile.c:  Add and option,
	  CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_SENDFILE to transfer files using the NuttX
	  sendfile() interface.
	* apps/netutils/discover:  A UDP network discovery utility contributed
	  by Max Holtzberg.
	* apps/examples/discover:  A test example for the UDP network discovery
	  utility (also contribed by Max Holtzberg).
	* apps/examples/*/main.c:  Too many files called main.c.  Each renamed
	  to something unique so that they will not collide in the archive.
	* apps/netutils/xmlrpc: The Embeddable Lightweight XML-RPC Server
	  discussed at http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/\
	  an-embeddable-lightweight-xml-rpc-server/184405364.  Contributed by
	  Max Holtzberg.
	* apps/netutils/uip_listenon.c:  Logic in uip_server.c that creates
	  the listening socket was moved to this new file to support re-use.
	  Contributed by Kate.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  The option CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_SINGLECONNECT
	  can now be used to limit the server to a single thread.  Option
	  CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_TIMEOUT can be used to generate HTTP 408 errors.
	  Both from Kate.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  Improvements to HTTP parser from
	  Kate.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  Add support for Keep-alive connections
	  (from Kate).
	* apps/NxWidget/Kconfig:  This is a kludge.  I created this NxWidgets
	  directory that ONLY contains Kconfig.  NxWidgets does not live in
	  either the nuttx/ or the apps/ source trees.  This kludge makes it
	  possible to configure NxWidgets/NxWM without too much trouble (with
	  the tradeoff being a kind ugly structure and some maintenance issues).
	* apps/examples/Make.defs: Missing support for apps/examples/watchdog.
	* apps/NxWidgets/Kconfig:  Add option to turn on the memory monitor
	  feature of the NxWidgets/NxWM unit tests.

6.23 2012-11-05 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* vsn: Moved all NSH commands from vsn/ to system/.  Deleted the vsn/
	  directory.
	* Makefile:  Change order of includes when CONFIG_NEWCONFIG=y.  In
	  that case, namedapp must be included first so that the namedapp
	  context is established first.  If the namedapp context is established
	  later, it will overwrite any existing namedapp_list.h and nameapp_proto.h
	  files.
	* CONFIG_EXAMPLES_*: To make things consistent, changed all occurrences
	  of CONFIG_EXAMPLE_* to CONFIG_EXAMPLES_*.
	* Kconfig:  Fleshed out apps/examples/adc/Kconfig and apps/examples/wget/Kconfig.
	  There are still a LOT of empty, stub Kconfig files.
	* Kconfig:  Fleshed out apps/examples/buttons/Kconfig. There are still a LOT
	  of empty, stub Kconfig files.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  Fix a bug that I introduced in
	  recent check-ins (Darcy Gong).
	* apps/netutils/webclient/webclient.c:  Fix another but that I introduced
	  when I was trying to add correct handling for loss of connection (Darcy Gong)
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_telnetd.c:  Add support for login to Telnet session via
	  username and password (Darcy Gong).
	* apps/netutils/resolv/resolv.c (and files using the DNS resolver): Various
	  DNS address resolution improvements from Darcy Gong.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c:  The ping command now passes a maximum round
	  trip time to uip_icmpping().  This allows pinging of hosts on complex
	  networks where the ICMP ECHO round trip time may exceed the ping interval.
	* apps/examples/nxtext/nxtext_main.c:  Fix bad conditional compilation
	  when CONFIG_NX_KBD is not defined.  Submitted by Petteri Aimonen.
	* apps/examples/nximage/nximage_main.c:  Add a 5 second delay after the
	  NX logo is presented so that there is time for the image to be verified.
	  Suggested by Petteri Aimonen.
	* apps/Makefile: Small change that reduces the number of shell invocations
	  by one (Mike Smith).
	* apps/examples/elf:  Test example for the ELF loader.
	* apps/examples/elf:  The ELF module test example appears fully functional.
	* apps/netutils/json:  Add a snapshot of the cJSON project.  Contributed by
	  Darcy Gong.
	* apps/examples/json:  Test example for cJSON from Darcy Gong
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netinit.c: Fix static IP DNS problem (Darcy Gong)
	* apps/netutils/resolv/resolv.c: DNS fixes from Darcy Gong.
	* COPYING: Licensing information added.
	* apps/netutils/codec and include/netutils/urldecode.h, base64.h, and md5.h:
	  A port of the BASE46, MD5 and URL CODEC library from Darcy Gong.
	* nsnlib/nsh_codeccmd.c:  NSH commands to use the CODEC library.
	  Contributed by Darcy Gong.
	* apps/examples/wgetjson: Test example contributed by Darcy Gong
	* apps/examples/cxxtest:  A test for the uClibc++ library provided by
	  Qiang Yu and the RGMP team.
	* apps/netutils/webclient, apps/netutils.codes, and apps/examples/wgetjson:
	  Add support for wget POST interface.  Contributed by Darcy Gong.
	* apps/examples/relays:  A relay example contributed by Darcy Gong.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds: Add ifup and ifdown commands (from Darcy
	  Gong).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds: Extend the ifconfig command so that it
	  supports setting IP addresses, network masks, name server addresses,
	  and hardware address (from Darcy Gong).

6.24 2012-12-20 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/ostest/roundrobin.c:  Replace large tables with
	  algorithmic prime number generation.  This allows the roundrobin
	  test to run on platforms with minimal SRAM (Freddie Chopin).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_dbgcmds.c:  Add hexdump command to dump the contents
	  of a file (or character device) to the console  Contributed by Petteri
	  Aimonen.
	* apps/examples/modbus:  Fixes from Freddie Chopin
	* apps/examples/modbus/Kconfig: Kconfig logic for FreeModBus contributed
	  by Freddie Chopin.
	* Makefile, */Makefile:  Various fixes for Windows native build.  Now uses
	  make foreach loops instead of shell loops.
	* apps/examples/elf/test/*/Makefile: OSX doesn't support install -D, use
	  mkdir -p then install without the -D.  From Mike Smith.
	* apps/examples/relays/Makefile: Reduced stack requirement (Darcy Gong).
	* apps/nshlib and apps/netutils/dhcpc:  Extend the NSH ifconfig command plus
	  various DHCPC improvements(Darcy Gong).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_apps.c: Fix compilation errors when CONFIG_NSH_DISABLEBG=y.
	  From Freddie Chopin.
	* Rename CONFIG_PCODE and CONFIG_FICL as CONFIG_INTERPRETERS_PCODE and
	  CONFIG_INTERPRETERS_FICL for consistency with other configuration naming.
	* apps/examples/keypadtest:  A keypad test example contributed by Denis
	  Carikli.
	* apps/examples/elf and nxflat:  If CONFIG_BINFMT_EXEPATH is defined, these
	  tests will now use a relative path to the program and expect the binfmt/
	  logic to find the absolute path to the program using the PATH variable.

6.25 2013-02-01 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Makefiles: Removed dependency of distclean on clean in most top-level
	  files.  It makes sense for 'leaf' Makefiles to have this dependency,
	  but it does not make sense for upper-level Makefiles.
	* apps/namedapp/: Renamed to builtins in preparation for another change.
	* .context:  Removed the .context kludge.  This caused lots of problems
	  when changing configurations because there is no easy way to get the
	  system to rebuild the context.  Now, the context will be rebuilt
	  whenever there is a change in either .config or the Makefile.
	* apps/builtin/registry:  Updated new built-in registration logic to handle
	  cases where (1) old apps/.config is used, and (2) applications ared
	  removed, not just added.
	* apps/examples/nettest/Makefile:  Fix an error that crept in during
	  some of the recent, massive build system changes.
	* apps/builtin/Makefile:  Need to have auto-generated header files
	  in place early in the dependency generation phase to avoid warnings.
	  It is not important if they are only stubbed out header files at
	  this build phase.
	* apps/examples/hidbkd: Now supports decoding of encoded special keys
	  if CONFIG_EXAMPLES_HIDKBD_ENCODED is defined.
	* apps/examples/hidbkd:  Add support for decoding key release events
	  as well.  However, the USB HID keyboard drier has not yet been
	  updated to detect key release events.  That is kind of tricky in
	  the USB HID keyboard report data.
	* apps/examples/wlan: Remove non-functional example.
	* apps/examples/ostest/vfork.c:  Added a test of vfork().
	* apps/exampes/posix_spawn: Added a test of posix_spawn().
	* apps/examples/ostest:  Extend signal handler test to catch
	  death-of-child signals (SIGCHLD).
	* apps/examples/ostest/waitpid.c:  Add a test for waitpid(), waitid(),
	  and wait().
	* builtin/binfs.c:  Add hooks for dup() method (not implemented).
	* builtin/exec_builtin.c, nshlib/nsh_parse.c, and nshlib/nsh_builtin.c:
	  NSH now supports re-direction of I/O to files (but still not from).
	* builtin/binfs.c:  Greatly simplified (it is going to need to be
	  very lightweight).  Now supports open, close, and a new ioctl to recover
	  the builtin filename.  The latter will be needed to support a binfs
	  binfmt.
	* builtin/binfs.c:  Move apps/builtin/binfs.c to fs/binfs/fs_binfs.c
	  CONFIG_APPS_BINDIR rename CONFIG_FS_BINFS
	* apps/include/builtin.h:  Some of the content of
	  apps/include/apps.h moved to include/nuttx/binfmt/builtin.h.
	  apps/include/apps.h renamed builtin.h
	* apps/builtin/exec_builtins.c:  Move builtin
	  utility functions from apps/builtin/exec_builtins.c to
	  binfmt/libbuiltin/libbuiltin_utils.c
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mountcmds.c:  The block driver/source
	  argument is now optional.  Many files systems do not need
	  a source and it is really stupid to have to enter a bogus
	  source parameter.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fileapp.c:  Add the ability to execute a file
	  from a file system using posix_spawn().
	* apps/builtin/: Extensions from Mike Smith.
	* apps/examples/ftpd/Makefile: Name ftpd_start is not the name of
	  the entrypoint.  Should be ftpd_main (from Yan T.)
	* apps/netutils/telnetd/telnetd_driver: Was stuck in a loop if
	  recv[from]() ever returned a value <= 0.
	* apps/examples/nettest and poll:  Complete Kconfig files.
	* apps/examples/ostest/waitpid.c:  Need to use WEXITSTATUS()
	  to decode the correct exit status.
	* apps/system/usbmonitor:  A daemon that can be used to monitor USB
	  trace outpout.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbdev.c, nsh_consolemain.c, nsh_session.c, nsh_script.c:
	  Add support for a login script.  The init.d/rcS script will be executed
	  once when NSH starts; the .nshrc script will be executed for each session:
	  Once for serial, once for each USB connection, once for each Telnet
	  session.
	* apps/system/readline: Correct readline() return value.  Was not
	  any returning special values when end-of-file or read errors
	  occur (it would return an empty string which is not very useful).

6.26 2013-03-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/builtin/exec_builtin.c:  Now uses task_spawn() to start
	  builtin applications.
	* Type of argv has changed from const char ** to char * const *
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Fix memory lead: Need to detach after
	  creating a pthread.
	* apps/examples and nshlib:  Change name of _TCB to struct tcb_s to
	  match NuttX name change.
	* apps/examples/ostest/restart.c:  Add a test case to verify
	  task_restart().
	* apps/system/readline.c:  readline() now returns EOF on any failure
	  (instead of a negated errno value).  This is because the underlying
	  read is based on logic similar to getc.  The value zero was being
	  confused with a NUL.  So if a NUL was received, the NSH session
	  would terminate because it thought it was the end of file.

6.27 2013-04-28 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/ramtest:  Add a simple memory test (2013-03-26).
	* apps/examples/ostest:  In the non-cancelable thread test, we need
	  to give the thread an opportunity to run and to set the non-
	  cancelable state.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_ddcmd.c: Correct the test of the skip input
	  parameter.  Was limiting the range to <= count.  From Ken
	  Pettit (2014-4-24).

6.28 2013-06-14 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/mtdpart:  Provides a simple test of MTD partitions.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c:  Add a -h option to the df command to show
	  the volume information in human readable form (Ken Pettit, 2013-4-30).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c: Add support for the mksmartfs command.
	  (Ken Pettit, 2013-4-30).
	* apps/system/flash_eraseall:  Add an interface to erase FLASH using a
	  flash_eraseall NSH command  (Ken Pettit, 2013-5-1).
	* apps/examples/flash_test and apps/examples/smart_test:  Add tests of
	  the SMART block driver and file system  (Ken Pettit, 2013-5-1).
	* apps/examples/mtdpart:  Extended the test.  The original test
	  coverage was superficial (2013-5-3).
	* apps/examples/smart:  This is an adaptation of the NXFFS stress
	  test for the SMART file system (Ken Pettit, 2013-5-3).
	* apps/examplex/nxtext:  Remove the CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NXTEXT_NOGETRUN
	  option.  The test logic was bad for the case where this options
	  is not selected.  Also, complete the empty Kconfig file (2013-5-7).
	* apps/NxWidgets/Kconfig:  Updated to match NxWidgets/Kconfig by
	  Ken Pettit (2013-5-11).
	* apps/examples/helloxx:  C++ name mangling was occurring when this
	  example is built as an NSH built-in application.  (2013-5-16).
	* apps/netutils/discover:  Added a runtime configuration for the
	  UDP discover utility.  From Max Holtzberg (2013-5-21).
	* apps/examples/tcpecho:  Added a simple single threaded, poll based
	  TCP echo server based on W. Richard Stevens UNIX Network Programming
	  Book.  Contributed by Max Holtzberg (2013-5-22).
	* apps/examples/slcd:  Add an example for testing alphanumeric,
	  segment LCDs (2013-5-24).
	* apps/examples/slcd:  Extend SLCD test to handle multi-line displays
	  (2013-5-26).
	* apps/examples/slcd:  This test now sets the SLCD brightness level to
	  the mid-point as part of its initialization (2013-5-27).
	* .gitignore:  Clean-up of most all .gitignore files:  Make scope of
	  ignore to be only the current directory; Ignore .dSYM files in
	  directories where .exe's may be build.  Also, in Makefiles,
	  clean .dSYM files in directories where .exe may be built (2013-5-30).
	* apps/examples/nrf35l01_term: Add an example application to demo the
	  nRF24L01 driver.  From Laurent Latil (2013-6-1).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig:  Add some missing NSH configuration values.
	  From Lorenz Meier (2013-6-2).
	* Standardize on CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS.  Remove all other variants
	  of the build-as-an-NSH-application configuration settings
	  (2013-6-12).

6.29 2013-07-31 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nsh, cxxtest, and helloxx:  C++ initializers should be
	  set once and, preferably, in the context of the task that uses any C++
	  statically initialized classes.  These only becomes an issue if cxxtest
	  or helloxx are built as NSH builtin applications.  Then you want the
	  initialization done in cxxtext or helloxx and not in NSH (and certainly
	  not twice).  Added configuration options to control who does the C++
	  initialization.  NSH now does not do C++ initialization be default and
	  must be configured to do otherwise.  Converely, cxxtest and helloxx
	  will do C++ initialization unless configured do otherwise (2013-6-21).
	* apps/examples/cxxtext:  Add ostream test as provided by Michael
	  (2013-6-21).
	* apps/examples/nxhello:  Minor fix for compilation error when the
	  display resolution is low (< 8bpp) due to a typo that has been there
	  for a long time (2013-6-23).
	* apps/examplex/nxhello:  Correct default colors when in Y1 code mode.
	  (2013-6-24).
	* apps/system/Make.defs and Kconfig:  The RAM test was not correctly built
	  into the configuration and build system (2013-6-26).
	* apps/examples/composite/composite_main.c:  SourceForge But Ticket #19.
	  Change to prevent some false alarm debug assertions (From Chia Cheng
	  Tao, 2013-7-9).
	* apps/system/zmodem:  Add configuration support and a build framework
	  for the Zmodem sz and rz command (which exist but have not yet been
	  checked in) (2013-7-12).
	* apps/system/zmodem:  The 'sz' command is now complete and seems
	  functional (given on light testing).  The rz command logic exists but
	  is still untested and not yet checked in  (2013-7-13).
	* apps/system/zmodem:  The 'rz' command is now complete and functional
	  under certain conditaions.  There are, however, some data overrun
	  issues that I am still uncertain how should be handled (2012-7-15).
	* apps/system/zmodem/Makefile.host and host/: The Zmodem utilities
	  can now be built to execute on a Linux host.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add a 'cmp' command that can be used to
	  compare two files for equivalence.  Returns an indication if the files
	  differ.  Contributed by Andrew Tridgell (via Lorenz Meier) (2013-7-18).

6.30 2013-09-14 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/composite/:  SourceForge bug #19: Fix a typo that can
	  cause a configuration error.  From CCTSAO (2013-9-4).
	* apps/examples/cc3000.  Initial support for the TI CC3000 network module
	  on the Freescale Freedom-KL25Z board from Alan Carvalho de Assis.
	  Includes the test to verify the CC3000 (2013-9-3).
	* apps/examples/usbmsc:  apps/examples/usbstorage renamed usbmsc.
	  Change submitted by CCTSAO (2013-6-5).
	* apps/examples/pwm:  Clean-up some configuration confusion (2013-9-5).
	* apps/netutils/dhcpd/dhcpd.c:  Fix calculation of the next lease
	  address.  SourceForge bug #21 from Paolo Messina (2013-9-6).
	* apps/examples/usbmsc:  Don't try to control USB trace if we are
	  an NSH built-in task.  In that case our attempts are inadequate
	  and only interfere with with other logic that is attempting to
	  to do the same thing (in NSH or in the USB monitor) (2013-9-6).
	* apps/examples/usbmsc:  IMPORTANT bug fix: Change how the msconn
	  works.  Because of recent changes the msconn command was hanging.
	  This was because the USB MSC start-up logic creates a pthread;
	  Now waitpid() will wait until all members of the task group
	  exit.  So NSH was hanging in waitpid when msconn started even
	  though msconn returned.  The USB MSC logic really should not use
	  a pthread, but we are stuck with that for now.  The work-around
	  is that msconn now daemonizes itself so that it so that the pthread
	  is created in a different task group (2013-9-7).
	* apps/system/usbmonitor:  The USB monitor has been extended so
	  that it can be used with USB device or host trace data (2013-9-9).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Fix NSH listing output for the case
	  of a single file.  Provided by Lorenz Meier (2013-9-13).

6.31 2013-10-28 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c:  Remove a warning when DHCP is not
	  enabled (2013-9-17).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig:  Default IP address should be 0x0a000001
	  (10.0.0.1), not 0xa0000001 (160.0.0.1).  Ditto for the gateway
	  (2013-9017).
	* apps/examples/ostest/Kconfig:  Add configuration options for
	  the FPU test.  There are still many OS test configuration
	  options that do not appear in Kconfig (2013-9-18).
	* apps/examples/cc3000:  Condition the CC3000 example on having
	  selected the CC3000 device.  Otherwise, you are prompted for
	  this option on each 'make oldconfig' (2013-9-18).
	* apps/system/usbmonitor/usbmonitor.c:  Fix some bad conditional
	  compilation probably introduced on 2013-9-9 (2013-9-23).
	* apps/system/stackmonitor:  Add a daemon that can be used to
	  monitor stack usage by all threads (2013-9-24).
	* system/usbmsc:  Move examples/usbmsc to system/usbmsc (2013-9-25).
	* system/cdcacm:  Move examples/cdcacm to system/cdcacm (2013-9-25).
	* system/composite:  Move examples/composite to system/composite
	  (2013-9-25).
	* apps/nshlib and apps/readline:  Numerous changes to get NSH
	  working with no file system.  Basically this suppresses I/O
	  redirection and replaces file I/O with calls to low-level
	  console read/write functions.  Suggested by Alan Carvalho de Assis
	  in a somewhat different form. (2013-9-30).
	* apps/nshlib/nsm_routecmds.c:  Add addroute and delroute
	  commands (2013-10-5).
	* apps/system/i2ctool/Kconfig:  Fix default I2C frequency:  400KHz
	  instead of 4MHz.  Suggested by Max Kriegleder (2013-10-10).
	* apps/system/info/Kconfig and Makefile:  Increase stack size.
	  Ken Pettit reports that this simple command can exceed its 768
	  stack size under certain conditions.  The size is marginal and
	  has been increased to 1024 by default but is also now configurable
	  (2013-10-14).
	* apps/Makefile:  Need to include external/Make.defs if we want
	  allow external applications to participate in the NuttX
	  configuration.  Suggested by gdi@embedders.org (2013-10-14).
	* apps/examples/cc3300: Updates as part of larger re-organizaion
	  of CC3000 logic by David Sidrane (2013-10-16).
	* apps/examples/random:  Add a simple test that dumps values from
	  /dev/random (2013-10-20).
	* apps/examples/cc3000:  Extensions and enhancements from David
	  Sidrane (2013-10-23).
	* apps/netutils/telnetd/telnetd_driver.c:  Missing argument to
	  debug statement can cause crashes in certain error conditions.
	  From David Sidrane (2013-10-24).
	* apps/examples/cc3000:  Updates from David Sidrane.  Plus
	  some kruft removal (2013-10-24).
	* apps/examples/can/can_main.c:  Correct an error in a debug
	  statement.  From Martin Lederhilger (2013-10-24).
	* apps/examples/adc:  Add support so that a ADC driven by
	  software triggering can be tested (2013-10-25).
	* apps/examples/cc3000:  Updates from David Sidrane (2013-10-25).
	* apps/system/nxplayer:  Implements a command line media
	  player.  From Ken Pettit (2013-10-27).
	* apps/system/nxplayer: Add logic to verify the audio sub-format.
	  From Ken Pettit (2013-10-28).

6.32 2013-12-07 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/platform:  A new home for board-specific application code
	  (2013-10-30).
	* apps/include/platform/configdata.h:  Define an interface that can be
	  used to manage platform-specific storage of configuration data
	  (2013-10-30).
	* apps/examples/cc3000: Fine tuning of memory usage from David Sidrane
	  (2013-10-30).
	* apps/platform/mikroe-stm32f4: Now supports storage of configuration
	  data.  From Ken Pettit (2013-10-30).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_dbgcmds.c and others:  Add skip= and count=
	  options to the hexdump command.  From Ken Pettit (2013-11-1).
	* apps/platform/mikroe-stm32f4:  Now uses /dev/config for configuration
	  data storage.  From Ken Pettit (2013-11-1).
	* apps/platform/Makefile:  Was not dealing with the bin sub-directory
	  correctly (2013-11-2).
	* apps/examples/configdata:  A unit test for the MTD configuration
	  data driver from Ken Pettit (2013-11-4).
	* apps/platform/mikroe-stm32f4:  Updated to use new MTD configuration
	  driver features.  From Ken Pettit (2013-11-1).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h:  Allow USB trace without a USB console. From
	  David Sidrane (2013-11-06).
	* apps/system/composite/composite_main.c:  The wrong handle was getting
	  nullified.  From David Sidrane (2013-11-7).
	* apps/system/nxplayer: Play thread stack size is now configurable.  All
	  NxPlayer threads now have names assigned via pthread_setname_np().
	  From Ken Pettit (2013-11-10).
	* apps/examples/i2schar:  The beginning of an I2S test based on the I2S
	  character driver (2013-11-10).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c:  Mount command updates from Ken Pettit
	  (2013-11-17).
	* apps/examples/hidkbd/hidkbd_main.c:  Now calls a function named
	  arch_usbhost_initialize() that must be provided by the platform-
	  specific code (2013-11-29).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add an option to the mkfatfs command to
	  specify FAT12, FAT16, or FAT32 (2013-12-5).

6.33 2014-01-30 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c:  Modified the df -h logic to eliminate
	  truncating numbers in conversion (like 7900 -> 7M).  From Ken
	  Pettit (2013-12-12).
	* Moved configs/stm3240g-eval/src/up_cxxinitialize.c to
	  apps/platform/stm3240g-eval/up_cxxinitialize.c:  Now it is available
	  in user-space in the kernel mode build (2013-12-29).
	* apps/examples/mount/Kconfig:  Fill in empty Kconfig file (2013-12-31).
	* builtin/Makefile: Fixes for native Windows build from Max Holtzberg
	  (2014-1-4).
	* apps/netutils/dhcpc/Kconfig, resolv/Kconfig, telnetd/Kconfig, and
	  apps/nshlib/Kconfig:  Refactor some configuration dependencies:  NSH
	  features should depend on netutil selections; netutil selections
	  should depend on networking selections. (2014-1-9).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_command.c:  Separate NSH command handling from NSH
	  line parsing.  This re-partitioning simplifies the logic and will
	  enable some things to come (2014-1-10).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Will now support multiple commands on a
	  command line, each separated with a semi-colon (2014-1-10).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Put the logic that executes a command
	  after parsing parameters into a separate file so that it can be
	  reused (2014-1-10).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Add initial support of commands enclosed
	  in back quotes as command arguments.  Functionality still incomplete
	  on initial commit (2014-1-10).
	* Logic to support commands enclosed in back quotes is functional
	  but not thoroughly tested (2014-1-11).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Can now handle arguments that are
	  concatenations of constant strings, command return data, application
	  return data, and environment variables (2014-1-11).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Fix a memory leak ... forgot to close
	  a temporary file (2013-1-12).
	* apps/system/inifile:  A simple INI file parser (perhaps too simple).
	  This is code that I wrote a long time ago and have used many time but
	  is untested in its current incarnation (2014-1-15).
	* aps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Recent changes broke redirection of output
	  (2014-1-14).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Add true and false commands (2014-1-17)
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h and nsh_parse.c:  Re-name and re-organize some
	  if-then-else related structures to better support forthcoming until
	  and while loops (2014-1-17).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_script.c:  Now saves the FILE stream for the script
	  file in the vtbl structure so that it can be accessed by forthcoming
	  while and until logic (2014-1-17).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h, nsh_command.c, nsh_parse.c, and nsh_script.c:  Add
	  support for while-do-done and until-do-done loops.  These only work
	  when executing a script file because they depend on the ability to seek
	  in the file to implement the looping behaviors (2014-1-17).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Loosen up if-then-else-fi syntax to allow
	  a command to be on the same line as the then and else tokens like:
	  "if true; then echo true; else echo false; fi".  Much more like bash!
	  (2014-1-17).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig, README.txt, nsh.h, nsh_command.c, and
	  nsh_script.c:  Add an option to conditionally compile out support for
	  loop and for if-then-else-fi sequence (2014-1-17).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h, nsh_command.c, and nsh_parse.c:  Add a break
	  command that can be executed with a loop to terminate the loop
	  immediately (2014-1-17).
	* apps/system/vi:  Add support for a tiny, VI work-alike editor.  This
	  is still very much a work-in-progress on initial check-in (2014-1-20).
	* apps/netutils/uiplib:  Support new definitions and state passing for
	  network device status. From Maz Holtzberg (2014-1-21).
	* apps/system/vi:  Tiny VI is basically functional.  All commands seem
	  to work.  There are still some display artifacts and probably several
	  untested conditions (2014-1-21).

7.1 2014-03-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/cle:  Add a EMACS-like command line editor.  This CLE,
	  is really more like readline than the NuttX readline is!  (2014-02-02).
	* apps/nshlib: Use of the standard tiny readline (about .25KB) is now
	  an option and can be replaces with the EMACX-like CLE (about 2KB)
	  (2014-02-02).
	* Several changes to restore Windows native build (2014-2-7)
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  Can now be configured to work with a mouse
	  interface as well (2014-2-10).
	* Several files changes based on complaints from the tool CppCheck.  Some
	  latent bugs were fixed (and most likely some new typos were introduced)
	  (2014-2-10).
	* apps/examples/nximage/Kconfig and apps/examples/uip/Kconfig: Incomplete
	  Kconfig files fleshed out by Alan Carvalho de Assis (2014-2-18).
	* apps/nshlib: 'rmdir' can now be used in the pseudo-filesystem.  Hence,
	  the command needs to be available even if there are no write-able
	  filesystem enabled (2014-2-19).
	* apps/nshlib: 'mkdir' can now be used in the pseudo-filesystem.  Hence,
	  the command needs to be available even if there are no write-able
	  filesystem enabled (2014-2-19).
	* apps/nshlib: 'mv' can now be used in the pseudo-filesystem.  Hence,
	  the 'mv' command needs to be available even if there are no write-able
	  filesystem enabled (2014-2-19).
	* apps/nshlib: 'rm' can now be used to remove nodes from the pseudo-
	  filesystem.  Hence, the 'rm' command needs to be available even if there
	  are no write-able filesystem enabled (2014-2-20).
	* CONFIG_DISABLE_PSEUDOFS_OPERATIONS: This new configuration setting
	  basically backs out the recent changes to mv, rm, mkdir, and rmdir
	  (2014-2-20).
	* nshlib/Kconfig:  Use CONFIG_DEFAULT_SMALL in selecting default
	  settings (2014-2-20).
	* nshlib/nsh_telnetd.c:  Use strncpy vs strcpy to avoid overruning the
	  username and password buffers.  From Bertold Van den Bergh (2014-2-22).
	* nshlib/Kconfig, nsh_proccmds.c:  If the CPU load feature and the procfs
	  features are enabled, then show CPU load used by each thread in the
	  'ps' command (2014-2-27).
	* nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add a newline after printing the file in the
	  'cat' command.  This prevents the NSH prompt from be in the same line
	  as the final line of the file in the case where there is no newline
	  at the end of the file (2014-2-27).
	* netutils/dhcpd/dhcpd.c: allocipaddr() should not call ntohl(), the
	  returned IP address is already in host order.
	* apps/netutils/dhcpd/Kconfig: Add missing DHCPD configuration
	  settings(2014-3-3).
	* Support for the legacy configuration mechanism (using appconfig files)
	  is removed.  Only the newer configuration using the kconfig-frontends
	  tools is now supported (2014-3-6).

7.2 2014-04-29 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c: Fix NuttShell version number display in
	  welcome message.  version.h was not being included (2014-3-23).
	* apps/examples/igmp:  Fill out Kconfig file; update makefile so
	  that the IGMP example can be used as an NSH built-in application.
	  From Manuel Stühn (2014-3-24).
	* apps/system/usbmsc:  Back out the USBMSC daemon... it is no longer
	  needed with the recent fix to the USBMSC class driver (2014-3-25).
	* apps/examples/lcdrw:  Fill out empty Kconfig file (2014-2-27).
	* apps/netutils/dhcpd/dhcpd.c:  The correct value of the PAD option
	  is zero, not one.  From Brennan Ashton (2014-3-31).
	* apps/sysinfo:   CONFIG_VERSION_BUILD is a string an needs to be
	  printed with %s, not %d.  Noted by Librae (2014-4-8).
	* apps/netutils/ntpclient/ and apps/include/netufils/ntpclient.h:  Add
	  a very primitive NTP client.  The initial check-in is untested and
	  probably incomplete (2014-4-10).
	* apps/netutils/resolv:  Long needed major clean up for coding style
	  and unification of naming conventions (resolv vs dns) (2014-4-11).
	* apps/netutils/dnsclient and include/netutils/dnsclient.h:  File name
	  changes that are part of the overal resolv->dns renaming (2014-4-11).
	* apps/netutils/dnsclient:  Break the one big monolithic file into
	  three smaller files (2014-4-11).
	* apps/netutils/ntpclient/ntpclient.c: Corrections to the NTP client
	  from Manuel Stuehn (2014-4-12).
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  Add a configuration option to indicate if
	  architecture-specific initialized is required, yes or no (2014-4-14).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c:  Compilation failure in one
	  configuration reported by Manuel Stuhn (2014-4-21).
	* apps/system/sdcard:  Remove an STM32 dependency.  From Bob Doiron
	  (2014-4-21).
	* apps/nshlib: malloc/free IOBUFFER for 'cat' and 'hexdump' commands
	  instead of using the stack.  From Bob Doiron (2014-4-21).
	* apps/examples/cpuhog, serialblaster, and serialrx:  Stress test
	  examples added by Bob Doiron (2014-4-22).
	* apps/examples/telnetd:  Naming is confused.  In someplaces 'telnetd',
	  and in others 'shell.'  All changes to telnetd.  Noted by Pelle
	  Windestam (2014-4-38).

7.3 2014-06-25 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/serialblaster:  Update configuration an make logic in
	  order to select that the serial blaster task priority and stack size.
	  From Bob Doiron (2014-4-30).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig and other NSH files:  The alternate console device
	  CONFIG_NSH_CONDEV must not be defined unconditionally.  This causes errors
	  when using Telnet sessions.  This was solved by adding CONFIG_NSH_ALTCONDEV:
	  CONFIG_NSH_ALTCONDEV enables or disables the feature then, if enabled,
	  CONFIG_NSH_CONDEV provides the alternative console device name (2014-5-5).
	* apps/system/i2c/i2c_get.c:  Fix to show the updated register address on
	  each fetch (vs. showing the same starting address each time).  From
	  Ryan VanSickle (2014-5-8).
	* apps/interpreters/prun and apps/include/interpreters/prun.h:  Broke out
	  the P-code execution logic from apps/examples/pashello and moved it to
	  these directory where it can be used more generally (2014-5-9).
	* apps/system/prun and apps/include/interpreters/pexec_main.c:  Move the
	  P-Code execution logic from apps/interpreters/prun to
	  apps/system/prun; Add pexec_main.c which is an NSH built-in
	  application that can be used to run P-Code programs from the NSH
	  command line (2014-5-9).
	* Several files: Convert all old-style variadic macros to the C99 form.
	  Recent GCC changes tightens up that behavior and can cause some problems
	  (at least for the IAR compiler for some reason).  See
	  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Variadic-Macros.html#Variadic-Macros.
	  Noted by Bob Grimes (2014-5-22).
	* apps/system/cle:  CLE was not returning the terminating newline character.
	  But reported by Max kriegleder; work-around reported by Lorenz Meier
	  (2015-5-23).
	* Misc changes due to moving nuttx/net/uip/uip-arp.h to nuttx/net/arp.h
	  (2015-5-30).
	* apps/examples/netpkt/:  A "raw" socket test from Lazlo Sitzer
	  (2014-6-12).
	* apps/system/hex2bin/:  A library and built-in task to convert from
	  Intel HEX to binary format.  Untested on initial commit (2014-6-15).
	* apps/system/hex2bin/: Appears to be functional but testing is still
	  light (2014-6-16).
	* apps/system/hex2bin/hex2mem_main: Add a variant application that will
	  write Intel HEX files directly to memory (2014-6-16).
	* netutils/webserver: httpd_fs_open() should return OK on success and
	  ERROR on failure, not 1 and 0 (2014-6-23)

7.4 2014-08-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/mdio:  PHY tool from Daniel Lazlo Sizter (2014-6-27).
	* apps/nshlib:  Networking logic modified to handler the case of SLIP
	  transport.  From Max Neklyudov (2014-6-27).
	* apps/nshlib:  if # appears on line, need to comment ignore additional
	  commands on the line (2014-7-1).
	* apps/netlib: Renamed all occurrences of uiplib to netlib.  Renamed
	  files under netutils/uiplib/uip_*.c to netutils/netlib/netlib_*.c.
	  Renamed all functions defined in netutils/netlib/ to begin with netlib_,
	  instead of uip_. (2014-7-2).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbkeyboard.c:  Add a configuration to use a USB
	  keyboard for the stdin device (2014-7-3).
	* apps/neturils/webclient/webclient.c:  Fix to offset calculation from
	  Rony Xln.  Prevents 0x0a at the beginning of lines (2014-7-7).
	* netutils/webserver (and other files):  Fix some configuration usage:
	  CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_SENDFILE was missing from Kconfig; CONFIG_NET_HAVE_SOLINGER
	  should be CONFIG_NET_SOLINGER; Type of CONFIG_NET_HTTPD_MAXPATH was wrong
	  in Kconfig file.  From Max (2014-7-11).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c:  Check for file read errors and end-of-file
	  with zero bytes read (2014-7-23).
	* apps/system/nxplayer: Misc changes to better integrate with
	  NxWM::CMediaPlayer (2014-7-23).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c and apps/include/nxplayer.h: Add hooks
	  for fast-forward and rewind needed by CMediaPlayer; add hooks for
	  equalizer settings needed by the WM8904  (2014-7-24).
	* apps/include/nxplayer.h and apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c: Changes to
	  integrate with Ken's NxWM::CMediaPlayer (2014-7-24).
	* apps/include/nxplayer.h: Move subsampling rate definitions from nxplayer.h
	  to audio.h *2014-7-27).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c: NxPlayer needs to set curbyte field to
	  zero before enqueuing a buffer.  Otherwise, it looks like beginning of
	  the buffer has already been consumed. (2014-7-27).
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  Missing logic to close sockets on loop
	  termination.  From Max (2014-7-28).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c:  Fix some error handling, update
	  comments, more debug output (2014-7-31).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c: Change how the end of the audio
	  stream is detected by the leaf audio component.  This used by be done
	  by looking for the first partial buffer.  That does not work with the
	  in-place sub-sampling performed by the PCM decoder:  That always reduces
	  the size of the buffer so that all buffers only partially filled by the
	  time they get to the leaf.  Now, a flag is set in the audio buffer
	  flags set to indicate the final buffer in the stream (2014-7-31).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c: Fix an error I introduced:  Need to
	  pass through final buffer even if is it zero length because it contains
	  the end of audio stream flag (2014-8-1).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c: Break reading and enqueueing of audio
	  buffers into two steps so that errors in enqueueing can be
	  distinguished from errors in reading.  Errors in enqueueing signal a
	  downstream decoder error.  Add logic to gracefully recover from
	  downstream decoder errors (2014-8-5).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig, nsh.h, and nsh_netinit.c: Software assigned MAC
	  address is now configurable. From Lazlo (2014-8-6).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig, nsh.h, and nsh_netinit.c: Also add an option to
	  let platform-specific logic select the MAC address (2014-8-5).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig, nsh.h, and nsh_netinit.c:  There is now a
	  configuration option that will bring up the network on an separate
	  thread.  Since the network bring-up is asynchronous, there are not
	  serial console start-up delays due to the network negotiation time
	  (2014-8-6).
	* apps/system/sudoku:  Add a sudoku game (2014-8-11).

7.5 2014-09-28 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig, nsh.h, and nsh_netinit.c:  Extend the NSH network
	  initialization logic.  There is now an option that will create a
	  network monitor thread that will monitor the state of the link.  When
	  the link goes down, the code will attempt to gracefully put the
	  Ethernet driver in a down state; When the link comes back, the code
	  will attempt to bring the network back up (2014-8-17).
	* apps/system/free/free.c and install/install.c: STM32 FLASH fixes:
	  use size_t instead of uint16_t, make interface more generic.  From
	  Freddie Chopin (2014-8-28).
	* apps/examples/elf:  The ELF test/example has been extended so the
	  individual ELF test programs can link against the SYSCALL library
	  (if it is available) or against the C library to eliminate or
	  minimize the need for symbol tables (2014-8-29).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_proccmds.c: Fix NSH PS command:  If there are no
	  arguments, it would print garbage for argument list (2014-9-1).
	* apps/import/, apps/tools/, apps/Makefile: Beginning of logic that
	  will, hopefully, allow me to build applications against a NuttX export
	  package (vs. the nuttx/ source tree) (2014-9-4).
	* apps/tools/mkimport.sh and apps/import/Makefile: Add .config file to
	  export package (2014-9-5).
	* apps/Makefile: Add a 'make import' target.  More is needed before
	  it will be usable (2014-9-5).
	* apps/import/Make.defs and .gitignore: Added mostly empty Make.defs
	  file.  Something like this will be bee needed for the 'make import'
	  build (2014-9-5).
	* apps/Makefile, examples/elf/Kconfig, and import/Make.defs: Copy more
	  logic from nuttx/tools/Config.mk into the Make.defs file (2014-9-5).
	* apps/import/Make.defs: Also need to define CFLAGS (2015-9-5)
	* apps/import/scripts/gnu-elf.ld:  Add GCC linker script for ELF
	  import builds (2014-9-5).
	* All Makefiles:  Add an install target to all makefiles.  For the
	  import build, the top-level Makefile now does two passes: (1) builds
	  libapp.a, then (2) installs the programs (not yet finished) (2014-9-6).
	* Many files:  With kernel build (CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL), entry point to
	  all tasks is main, not some xyz_main (2014-9-6).
	* Many Makefiles: Add program installation for CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL in
	  all Makefiles that build a main() (2014-9-6).
	* Many Makefiles.  For kernel build, the object file containing main
	  cannot go into library because of name collisions.  The object file
	  must be handled as a special case in every Makefile (2014-9-7).
	* apps/import/Make.defs: libapps.a needs to be added to the list of
	  libraries to link against (2014-9-7).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h and nsh_ddcmd.c: Several commands must be disabled
	  in the kernel build because they depend on interfaces that are not
	  available outside of the kernel: dd, df, losetup, mkfatfs, mkdr, and
	  ps (2014-9-7).
	* apps/import/Make.defs: ELF build requires -fno-common in CFLAGS
	  (2014-9-8).
	* apps/tools/mkromfsimg.sh:  Add a script to create a BOOT ROMFS
	  filesystem image (2014-9-9).
	* Many makefiles:  All makefiles that have separated the MAINOBJ
	  need to include MAINOBJ in list of C objects to be compiled.
	  SourceForge tick #31 from Aton (2014-9-11).
	* apps/examples/elf/tests/Makefile and nxflat/tests/Makefile: Do
	  not build test cases that use task_create if there is an address
	  environment (2014-9-14).
	* apps/examples/null/null_main.c:  Need to include config.h it order know
	  if this is or is not a kernel build (2014-9-16).
	* Change all occurrences of NxConsole to NxTerm (2014-9-20).
	* apps/examples/Konfig, Makefile, README.txt and all of mdrwb/: Add an
	  example to test MTD R/W buffering (2014-9-25).
	* apps/examples/ostest:  Add a trivial test of sem_timedwait (2014-9-16).

7.6 2014-11-26 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/ostest:  Add a simple test of named semaphores
	  (2014-9-23).
	* apps/netutils/webclient/Kconfig and webclient.c: Add implementation of
	  timeouts for the apps/netutils/webclient.  From Brennan Ashton
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig and nsh_romfsetc.c: Add support for a custom NSH
	  ROMFS startup image header file location.  From Martin Lederhilger
	  (2014-9-30).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Fix ls -l output for regular files (14-9-30).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_ddcmd.c: Fix reversed in/out file closing when an
	  error occurs.  From Ken Pettit (2014-10-2).
	* apps/examples/ostest/aio.c, Kconfig, Makefile, and ostest_main.c: Add
	  AIO test case in OS test (2014-10-5).
	* apps/examples and system:  Remove non-portable uses of syslog
	  (014-10-8).
	* apps/: Correct everything under apps to use the corrected syslog
	  interfaces (2014-10-8).
	* apps/netutils/netlib/netlib_gethostaddr.c: Fix memcpy of host address
	  in netlib_gethostaddr().  From Brennan Ashton (2014-10-17).
	* apps/system/stackmonitor.c and stackmonitor/Makefile: Fix compile
	  problems introduced when the syslog() prototype changed; Also update
	  Makefile for kernel build From Radoslaw Adamczyk (2014-10-23).
	* apps/examples/nxterm/Makefile: Update makefile for kernel-build
	  issues. From Radoslaw Adamczyk (2014-10-23).
	* apps/examples/keypadtest/keypadtest_main.c: Fixes to keypadtest from
	  Pierre-Noel Bouteville (2014-10-23).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c, nsh.h, and Kconfig: Move CONFIG_NSH_TMPDIR
	  to CONFIG_LIBC_TMPDIR (2014-11-05).
	* apps/interpreter/bas:  Merged in the Michael Haardt's BAS 2.4 adapted
	  for use by NuttX by Alan Carvalho de Assis.  The bas24 branch was merged
	  into the master branch on this date (2014-11-7).
	* apps/examples/bastest:  This is a special version of Michael
	  Haardt's BAS 2.4 test files adapted for use by NuttX on a ROMFS file
	  system (2014-11-7).
	* apps/interpreter/bas: Add VT100 support for color command (2014-11-10).
	* nshlib/: Remove use of CONFIG_MAX_TASKS in ps command and in range
	  checkout (2014-11-13).
	* netutils/thttpd:  Remove use of CONFIG_MAX_TASKS in in 'task' CGI
	  example (2014-11-13).
	* sysm/i2c: Remove use of CONFIG_MAX_TASKS for maximum argument I2C
	  tool size (2014-11-13).
	* apps/netutils/dnsclient/dns_socket.c:  Right now if you make a DNS
	  request before the dns address it set you will get an assertion. The
	  state of the IP setting is not something the application should be
	  aware of, it should only be concerned with whether or not the name
	  was resolved.  From Brennan Ashton (2014-11-13).
	* apps/nshlib/, apps/netutils, and apps/include/netutils:  Misc
	  changes to support multiple networks with different link layers.  For
	  example, ETHERNET + SLIP (2014-11-15).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbconsole.c:  Add logic to restart the console wait
	  if an error occurs while reading from the console.In USB console
	  startup, the logic must be able to open the USB serial and receive 3
	  newlines.  However, it the USB driver is disconnected or otherwise
	  fails before the 3 newlines are received, the receive loop becomes a
	  killer, infinite loop, CPU hog.  Noted by spasbyspas (2014-11-16).
	* examples/, netutils/, nshlib/, various files:  Rename
	  CONFIG_NET_BUFSIZE to CONFIG_NET_ETH_MTU; Add CONFIG_NET_SLIP_MTU.
	  Modify logic to handle different MTUs when both Ethernet and SLIP
	  are enabled (2014-11-16).
	* apps/examples/discover, tcpecho, webserver, xmlrpc:  These examples
	  all set the IP address of eth1 but the netmask and gateway of eth0
	  if DHCP is enabled.  That can't be right???? (2014-11-17).
	* apps/examples/bridge:  Add a simple UDP relay bridge for testing
	  configurations with multiple networks.  Initial checkin is not
	  very usuable because it lacks a host-side test driver for the
	  bridge (2014-11-17).
	* apps/netutils/codecs/md5.c: Fix md5 hashing when digest[$i] lower
	  that 16. From Sergey (2015-11-20).
	* apps/examples/bridge/host_main.c, host_net1.c, host_net2.c, Kconfig,
	  and Makefile:  Add host-side test driver (2014-11-21).

7.7 2015-01-26 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/romfs/Makefile: fix romfs example builtin app registry
	  issue.  From Librae (2014-11-27).
	* apps/examples/djoystick and support files:  Add a test of the discrete
	  joystick driver (2014-11-28).
	* apps/examples/ajoystick and support files:  Add a test of the analog
	  joystick driver (2014-12-03).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c: NSH TFTP get command:  Wrong file namei
	  used for the destination.  From Lazlo (2014-12-10).
	* apps/system/cu: Add a minimalist implementation  of the 'cu' terminal
	  program (part of Taylor UUCP for ages). Using it, you can simply open
	  a serial port and interact with it. Using '~.' you can leave the
	  terminal program and drop back to nsh.  This  might come in handy for
	  people that have e.g. GSM modems, GPS receivers or other devices with
	  text based serial communications attached to their Nuttx systems. From
	  Harald Welte (2014-12-13).
	* apps/examples/ltdc and build-related file: Add ltdc test example. From
	  Marco Krahl (2014-12-19).
	* apps/system/cdcacm, composite and usbmsc:  Fix some strangely placed
	  conditional compilation.  Looks like an automated update gone awry
	  (2014-12-28).
	* apps/examples/ltdc/ltdc_main.c:  Clean up documentation, some formatting
	  improvements.  From Marco Krahl (2014-12-29).
	* apps/system/lm75 and build-related files:  Add a tiny application to
	  read the temperature from an LM-75 (or compatible) temperature sensor
	  (2015-01-06).
	* apps/interpreters/micropython:  A port of Micro Python to NuttX.
	  Contributed by Dave Marples (2015-01-11).
	* apps/examples/timer:  Add a trivial test of the timer driver
	  (2015-01-13).
	* apps/netutils/dnsclient:  Can select to be either IPv4 or IPv6, but
	  not both (IPv6 still does not compile) (2015-01-18).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  Add new library functions to manipulate IPv6
	  addresses (2015-01-13).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig and nsh_netinit.c:  Add logic to initialize
	  IPv6 addresses (2015-01-19).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  All IOCTLs must use a valid address family --
	  even if the address family does not matter such as when getting the
	  MAC address or the network flags (2015-01-19).
	* apps/examples/nettest:  Update test so that it can be used to test
	  IPv6 TCP sockets (2015-01-20).
	* Many files: Correct name of fields in struct sockaddr_in6:  sin6_port
	  and sin6_family, not sin_port and sin_family (2015-01-20).
	* apps/netutils/telnetd:  Add protection when CONFIG_SCHED_HAVE_PARENT
	  is enabled:  Call sigaction with SA_NOCLDWAIT so that exit status is
	  not retained (no zombies) and block receipt of SIGCHLD so that accept
	  is not awakened by a signal.  If accept() is awakened by a signal, do
	  not do anything crazy like exit.  Most from Rony Xln (2015-01-22).
	*  apps/examples/udp:  The UDP test example has been extend to support
	  IPv6 domain sockets (2015-01-22).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add the ping6 command to support checking IPv6 networks.
	  (2015-01-23).
	* apps/nsh: Clean up network status presentation for IPv6 (2015-01-24).

7.8 2015-02-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/interpreters/micropython: Add math library defines for nan(),
	  copysign(), and trunc() functions.  From Brennan Ashton (2015-01-26).
	* apps/examples/ustream:  Add a simple test of Unix domain sockets
	  (2015-01-27).
	* apps/examples/udgram:  Add a simple test of Unix domain datagram
	  sockets (2015-01-28)
	* apps/Makefile and builtin/Makefile: Fix for building with parallel
	  make. Build-server sometimes failed 'make -j24' with errors in the
	  builtin line or or sometimes silently succeeds but generated builds
	  that contain a random subset of configured NuttX applications. There
	  are two root causes for this: (1) Recipes for building builtin_list.h
	  and builtin_proto.h are not linearizable, and (2) Nothing ensures
	  that 'make context' is run first for apps/builtin.  This change
	  address both issues. From Juha Niskanen (2015-02-03).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  Add utilities to convert to/from prefix lengths
	  from/to 128-bit network masks (2015-02-06).
	* apps/nshlib: Modify the NSH IPv6 ifconfig command to show the more
	  standard post-pended prefix value, rather than the full 128-bit netmask
	  (2015-02-06).

7.9 2015-04-14 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/ostest: Improved error checking for sem_timedwait()
	  from Juha Niskanen (2015-02-20).
	* apps/netutils/Kconfig, Make.defs, and pppd/: Add a PPP daemon.  From
	  Max Neklyudov (2015-03-11).
	* Rename arch_nshinitialize() to board_app_initialize() (2015-03-30).
	* apps/nshlib:  NSH initialization now calls boardctl(BOARDIOC_INIT)
	  instead of board_app_initaliaze().   Remove support for
	  CONFIG_NSH_ARCHMAC.  It is not used and there are better ways to do
	  that operation (2015-03-31).
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  No longer calls arch_tcinitialize() or
	  arch_tcuninitialize().  Instead the new OS interface boardctl() is
	  called to perform these test operations on the touchscreen driver
	  (2015-03-31).
	* apps/examples/adc: Change apps/examples/adc to that is now calls
	  boardctl() instead of adc_devinit() in order to initalize the ADC
	  device(2015-03-31).
	* apps/examples/pwm/: Replace calls to pwm_devinit() in
	  apps/examples/pwm with calls to boardctl() (2015-03-31).
	* apps/examples/:  More renaming: up_lcdinitialize->board_lcd_initialize,
	  up_lcdgetdev->board_lcd_getdev, up_lcduninitialize->board_lcd_uninitialize
	  (2015-04-04).
	* apps/examples/nxlines/: Add the new 'capped' parameter to nx_drawline()
	  calls (2015-04-05).
	* apps/modbus/tcp:  Fix some complile problems when TCP is enabled
	  (2015-04-06).
	* apps/system: Clean up Kconfig menus.  The way it worked before, it was
	  difficult to see what was enabled and what was not.  menus replaced
	  with menuconfig (2015-04-07).
	* apps/examples/ostest/sigprocmask.c: Add a simple test of sigprocmask,
	  sighold, and sigrelse (2015-04-09).
	* apps/modbus: Includes extensions to support RTU master mode by
	  Armink(383016632@qq.com):
	  https://github.com/armink/FreeModbus_Slave-Master-RTT-STM32.  Ported
	  to NuttX by Darcy Gong.
	* apps/nshlib:  Allow NSH 'date' command with no hardware RTC.  Thisi
	  command is useful without an RTC too.  Also, this permits testing on
	  the simulator which never has an RTC (2015-04-11).
	* apps/netutils/ppp: Make pppd PAP authentication optional.  From
	  Brennan Ashton
	* apps/examples/pppd:  Add PPPD test case.  Split out from
	  apps/netutils/pppd by Brennan Ashton.
	* apps/netutils/pppd: Spit up pppd utils.  From Brennan Ashton.
	* apps/system/zoneinfo:  All logic to build timezone info.  Does not do
	  much else yet (2015-04-14).

7.10 2015-06-09 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/zoneinfo:  Add logic to build a ROMFS file system
	  containing the timezone data (2015-04-15).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_timcmds.c: Check return values from time functions
	  (2015-04-15).
	* apps/examples/nxlines:  Fix missing right bracket that causes
	  compile error when CONFIG_NX_XYINPUT=y.  From Librae (2015-04-16).
	* apps/examples: When boardctl() fails, need to print errno not the
	  returned value which will always be -1 (2015-04-16).
	* apps/examples: Correct use of the BOARDIOC_GRAPHICS_SETUP boardctl()
	  call (2015-04-16).
	* apps/examples/ltdc:  Add testing support for the STM32 LTDC's 2D
	  DMA. From Marco Krahl (2015-04-16).
	* apps/nshlib/: Fix handling of gmtime_r return value in time commands.
	  gmtime_r returns a pointer, not an int (2015-04-21).
	* apps/netutils/ntp: Fix mismatched sched_lock/unlock.  Noted by
	  Juha Niskanen (2015-05-06).
	* apps/examples:  Modify/simpify apps/examples build files.  From Roman
	  Saveljev (2015-05-06).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netinit.c and apps/examples/ustream/: Add poll
	  support for Unix stream sockets.  From Jussi Kivilinna (2015-05-12).
	* apps/examples/ostest: Add a test of nested signals.  There are no
	  failures to handle signals but neither am I getting any nested
	  signal handling (2015-05-12).
	* apps/nshlib: Enhancements to NSH ifconfig for case of multi-link
	  operation, TUN device and local connections.  From Max Neklyudov
	  (2015-05-19).
	* apps/nshlib: Enhanced output to NSH ping command from Max Neklyudov
	  (2015-05-27).
	* apps/examples/elf: Add configuration options to support building the
	  hello++4 example that depends upon having uClibc++ available.  From
	  Leo aloe3132 (2015-05-29).
	* apps/platform/stm32f4discovery: Move up_cxxinitialize from
	  nuttx/configs/stm32f4discovery/src to apps/platform/stm32f4discovery
	  where it belongs (2015-05-29).
	* apps/examples/elf/tests/helloxx: Add hello++5 to ELF example.  From
	  Leo Aloe3132 (2015-06-01).
	* apps/netutils/thttpd/ and apps/examples/thttpd/: Add support for using
	  binfs/ instead of NXFLAT.  NXFLAT is probably the better solution but
	  recently compiler changes make it unusable.  binfs or ELF are fallback
	  binary formats.  This commit adds an option to use binfs (2015-06-02).
	* apps/examples/unionfs: Add a test of the union file system to
	  apps/examples (2015-06-05).
	* apps/examples/thttpd now uses the Union File System if BINFS is
	  selected for CGI binaries (2015-06-06).
	* apps/nshlib/: The NSH mount command now recognizes the Union file
	  system type when listing mounted file systems (2015-06-07).

7.11 2015-08-13 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/netutils/thttpd:  Fix compilation problems when
	  CONFIG_THTTPD_GENERATE_INDICES is defined (2015-06-12).
	* apps/include: Clean up and review of header files for conformance to
	  standards (2015-06-12).
	* apps/examples/ostest/:  Extend the OS test to include a test of
	  pthread_mutex_trylock() for recursive mutexes. From Juha Niskanen
	  (2015-06-16).
	* apps/netutils/thttpd: Missing gci-src as a dependency path when
	  building with BINFS enabled (2015-06-18).
	* The apps/ directory has been removed from the NuttX GIT repository
	  and now stands alone in its own repository (2015-06-27).
	* apps/examples/poll: Fix a few bit-rot compilation errors (2015-07-01).
	* apps/nshlib: NSH will now support an (optional) shutdown command if
	  the board provides the option CONFIG_BOARDCTL_POWEROFF.  The command can
	  also be used to reset the system if CONFIG_BOARDCTL_RESET=y.
	  (2015-07-04).
	* apps/system/poweroff:  Remove the system poweroff command.  This is
	  replaced with the NSH shutdown command (2015-07-02).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add support for a uname command (2015-07-04).
	* apps/system/sysinfo:  Remove the system sysinfo command.  This is
	  replaced with the NSH uname command (2015-07-04).
	* apps/syste/netdb:  Add a command to access the network database
	  (2015-07-08).
	* apps/netutils/dnsclient and include/netutils/dnsclient.h:  Move the
	  DNS client logic into the NuttX C library.  It is a necessary part
	  for the full implementation of the netdb logic and provides more
	  flexibility in that location (2015-07-10).
	* apps/examples/ and apps/netutils: Remove calls to obsolete, non-
	  functional DNS interfaces (2015-07-11).
	* apps/netutils and apps/nshlib: Replace calls to the non-standard
	  dns_gethotip with calls to standard gethostbyname (2015-07-11).
	* apps/netutils/netlib and other files: Create netlib wrapper functions
	  around dns_getserver() and dns_setserver() to isolate application
	  code from changes to those interfaces (2015-07-12).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add an nslookup command (2015-07-13).
	* apps/examples/nxlines:  If CONFIG_NX_ANTIALIASING=y, then the nxlines
	  example now erases a line that is 2 pixels longer and 2 pixels wideri
	  than the line it drew.  That eliminates edges effects due to applying
	  the anti-aliasing algorithm twice.  A better solution would be to makei
	  anti-aliasing an option for each graphics call so you would rend the
	  line with anti-aliasing ON and clear it with anti-aliasing OFF. but I
	  don't have the wherewithal for that change today (2015-04-14)`.
	* apps/nshlib and apps/examaples/thttpd:  Change decoding to handle the
	  increased size of the scheduling policy field in the TCB (2015-07-23).
	* apps/examples/ostest: Improve synchronization in round robin tests.
	  On very fast processors, there are race conditions that make the test
	  failure.  Need better interlocking to assure that the threads actually
	  do start at the same time (2015-07-24).
	* apps/examples/ostest: Add a test for the sporadic scheduler.  This
	  test is failing as of this commit (2015-07-24).
	* apps/system/readline:  Add support for Unix-style tab complete toi
	  readline.  This currently works only for built-in functions.
	  Contributed by Nghia Ho (2015-07-28).
	* apps/system/readline and apps/nshlib:  Extended the tab-completion
	  support to also expand NSH command names (2015-07-30).
	* apps/system/readline and apps/nshlib:  Add support for an in-memory
	  command line history that can be retrieved using the up and down
	  arrows.  Contributed by Nghia Ho (2015-08-09).
	* apps/Makefile:  No longer depends on hardcoded lists of directories.
	  Instead, it does a wildcard search to find all appropriate
	  directories.  This means that to install a new application, you
	  simply have to copy the directory (or link it) into the apps/
	  directory.  If the new directory includes a Makefile and Make.defs
	  file, then it will automatically be included in the build (2015-08-11).
	* apps/Makefile, Kconfig, */Kconfig, tools/mkkconfig.sh: Add the tool
	  mkkconfig.sh that dynamically builds the apps/Kconfig file at
	  configuration time.  The hardcoded configuration file has been removed
	  and now the top-level Makefile executes tools/mkkconfig.sh to auto-
	  generate the top-level Kconfig file.  A new apps/ make target call
	  preconfig: was added to support this operation.  Now you do not have
	  to modify the top-level Kconfig file to add a new directory into the
	  configuration; the top-level subdirectory simply needs to include a
	  Kconfig file and it will automatically be included in the
	  configuration.  The native Windows build is temporarily broken until
	  a new apps/tools/mkconfig.bat script is generated (2015-08-11).
	* apps/tools/mkkconfig.bat:  Add the Windows script corresponding to
	  apps/tools/mkkconfig.sh.  Needed for a Windows native build.  Untested
	  on initial commit (2015-08-12).

7.12 2015-10-01 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/can:  Extend the CAN loopback test by adding more
	  command line options (2015-08-17).
	* apps/examples/usbserial: Can now be run as an NSH builtin-function.
	  Now uses a configurable IO buffer size (2015-08-20).
	* Various Kconfig files in netutils:  Fix some changes from from
	  NETUTILS_DNSCLIENT to NETDB_DNSCLIENT.  From Pavel Pisa (2015-08-20).
	* system/netdb:  Failed to build if CONFIG_NET_HOSTFILE was not defined
	  because gethostbyaddr() was not available.  Noted by OrbitalFox
	  (2015-08-21).
	* apps/system/symtab: Optional canned symtab inclusion to the build. When
	  option CONFIG_SYSTEM_SYMTAB is selected and symbol table file
	  libc/symtab/canned_symtab.inc is prepared then application can
	  use system provided complete symbol table. The option has
	  substantial effect on system image size. Mainly code/text. If
	  loading of applications at runtime is not planned do not select
	  this.  From Pavel Pisa (2015-08-23).
	* apps/examples/nettest: Add option to suppress network initialization.
	  This is necessary if the nettest is run from NSH which has already
	  initialized the network (2015-08-26).
	* apps/examples/nettest: Extend test so that can be performed using the
	  local loopback device (2015-08-26).
	* apps/nshlib: Fix error handling in 'cat' command.  On a failure to
	  allocate memory, a file was not being closed.  From Bruno Herrera
	  (2015-08-26).
	* apps/nshlib: Fix error handling in 'mv' command.  On a failure to
	  expand the second path, the memory allocated for the expansion of the
	  first path was not being freed.  From Bruno Herrera (2015-08-26).
	* apps/examples/netloop:  Add a test of the local loopback device
	  (2015-09-02).
	* apps/modbus and apps/include/modbus:  Macros PR_BEGIN_EXTERN_C and
	  PR_END_EXTERN_C were not defined in all contexts.  Replace with
	  explicit expansion in all cases. From Stefan Kolb (2015-09-03).
	* apps/canutils/uavcan: Add support for libuavcan.  From  Paul
	  Alexander Patience (2015-09-25).
	* apps/examples/udpblaster: Add a test to stress the network by
	  sending UDP packets at a very high rate.  (2015-09-30).
	* apps/examples/uavcan: libuavcan example from Paul Alexander
	  Patience (2015-10-01).

7.13 2015-12-05 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/fstest:  Add a generic file system test.  This is
	  essentially the same as examples/smart, but has all of the SmartFS
	  specific logic ripped out.  This was created for testing the new
	  tmpfs (2015-10-10).
	* apps/examples/zerocross: Add a Zero Cross application example.
	  From Alan Carvalho de Assis (2015-10-13).
	* apps/examples/media:  Add a simple test for access of media via
	  a block driver or MTD driver (2015-11-09).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_ddcmd.c:  Now that NuttX automatically converts
	  block devices to character devices, all of the BCH stuff in NSH
	  can be removed (2015-11-21).
	* apps/system/hexed:  Port the hexed command line hexadeciamal
	  editor to Nuttx.  See http://apps.venomdev.net/hexed/.
	  Initial port is not functional (2015-11-21).
	* apps/fsutils/smartfs: Move into apps/fsutils from kernel, now
	  uses only open and ioctl.  From Ken Pettit (2015-11-23).
	* apps/fsutils/smartfs/ and apps/nshlib/: Add configuration option
	  to supported multiple root directories. From Ken Pettit (2015-11-23).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add support for 'basename' and 'dirname' commands
	  (2015-11-23).
	* apps/nshlib:  Like bash, NSH set command should strip off any
	  leading or trailing whitespace (2015-11-23).
	* apps/nshlib: The mount commands now accepts mount options (currently
	  needed only for the hostfs file system).  From Ken Pettit (2015-11-25).
	* apps/nshlib:  NSH no longer calls losetup() and loteardown directly.
	  Now it opens /dev/loop and accomplishes these things using ioctl()
	  calls (2015-11-25).
	* apps/nshlib:  If CONFIG_NETDEV_STATISTICS=y, then print the network
	  driver statistics in the ifconfig (15-11-26).
	* apps/nshlib:  The 'ifconfig' command now uses /proc/net/<dev> to view
	  network device configuration and status and /proc/net/stat to show
	  network statistics.  A consequence of this is that you cannot view
	  this network information if the procfs is not enabled and mounted at
	  /proc (2015-11-27).
	* apps/nshlib:  Remove all references to internal OS interface
	  netdev_foreach().  Logic in ifconfig, ifup, and ifown now use the
	  procfs file system to examine networking status.  (2015-11-27).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add a new NSH losmart command.  losmart setups up
	  a loop device for the smart MTD driver similar to losetup but
	  with different syntax.  From Ken Pettit (2015-11-28).
	* apps/nshlib:  The I/O buffer, g_iobuffer, should not be a global
	  buffer.  That will not work in an environment where there are multiple
	  NSH sessions.  The I/O buffer must, instead, be a part part of the
	  session-specific data defined in nsh_console.h (2015-11-28).
	* apps/nshlib:  The 'ps' command now uses /proc/<pid>/ to obtain
	  task status information.  A consequence of this is that you cannot use
	  the 'ps' command if the procfs is not enabled and mounted at
	  /proc (2015-11-28).

7.14 2016-xx-xx Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* netutils/telnetd:  Move the Telnet driver from netutils/telnetd to
	  nuttx/drivers/net.  It is a driver an belongs in the OS.  There are
	  still some partitioning issues with the interface to the Telnet
	  driver (2015-12-07).
	* netutils/telnetd:  No longer calls OS interface telnet_driver.  Now
	  creates Telnet sessions by opening a new factory device at /dev/telnet
	  and then using ioctl calls to create the session character drivers
	  at /dev/telnetN (2015-12-07).
	* netutils/ping: Unfinished implementation of ping/ping6 using raw
	  sockets (2015-12-11).
	* examples/module:  Add a test harness for verifying NuttX kernel
	  modules (2015-12-12).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add module commands: insmod, rmmod, and lsmod
	  (2015-12-13).
	* apps/examples/pca9635:  Add a simple test of PCA9635PW PWM LED
	  driver.  From Alan Carvalho de Assis (2015-12-15).
	* apps/examples/ostest:  Add a test of POSIX timers using
	  SIGEV_THREAD (2015-12-30).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add a 'time' command that may be used to time the
	  execution of other commands (2015-12-31).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  Add netlib_get_dripv4addr() and
	  netlib_get_ipv4netmask().  From Pelle Windestam (2016-01-14).
	* apps/fsutils/passwd: Utility library for accessing a password
	  file like /etc/passwd (2016-01-19).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_passwdcmds.c:  Add useradd, userdel, and passwd
	  commands (2016-01-20).
	* apps/nshlib:  Now supports a Message of the Day (MOTD) that will
	  be presented after the NSH greeting (2015-01-20).
	* apps/nshlib:  All sessions may be protected with logins using
	  the encrypted password in /etc/passwd (2016-01-20).
	* apps/fsutils/inifile:  Move system/inifile to fsutils/inifile
	  where it seems to fit in better (2016-01-20).
	* apps/nshlib: Extend logins.  Added: Optional platform-specific
	  function to perform password verification and optional delay
	  after each failed login attempt (2016-01-22).
	* system/ramtron:  Removed completely.  It inappropriately used
	  an internal OS interface (up_spiinitialize), that has been
	  obsoleted.  That's what happens when you violate interface
	  boundaries between the application and the OS (2016-01-27).
	* apps/platform/Makefile:  Use a relative path to the board
	  directory link rather than the absolute path.  For Cygwin, the
	  absolute would would need converted with cygpath.  But just using
	  the relative path is a simpler solution (2016-01-27).

7.15 2016-03-27 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/chat and apps/netutils/chat:  Contributed by
	  Vladimir Komendantskiy (2016-01-29).
	* apps/examples/ubloxmodem:  app to control the power state of the
	  modem in nsh.  From  Vladimir Komendantskiy (2016-01-31).
	* apps/system/ubloxmodem:  Moved the modem application from
	  examples/ to system/ (2016-01-31).
	* apps/system/i2c:  The I2C tool now obeys it OS interfacing:
	  it now uses an I2C character driver to access the I2C bus
	  (2016-02-02).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  Add utility functions to support accesses
	  to the ARP table (2016-02-08).
	* apps/netutils/dhcpd: DHCPD no longer calls directly into the
	  OS but uses the new network IOCTL commands to modify the ARP
	  table (2016-02-08).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add an 'arp' command that will support access to
	  the OS ARP table (2016-02-08).
	* apps/nshlib: 'ps' command will show CPU if SMP is enabled
	  (2016-02-19).
	* apps/examples/leds: An example to demonstrate use of LED
	  driver (2016-02-20).
	* apps/examples/smp:  Add a test to verify SMP configurations
	  (2016-02-21).
	* apps/examples/rgbled:  Example using the RGB LED driver to
	  drive an RGB LED via PWM.  From Alan Carvalho de Assis
	  (2016-02-23).
	* apps/platform/sabre-6quad:  Add a platform directory for the
	  Sabre 6Quad board (2016-03-01).
	* apps/examples/ostest:  Add a test of TLS (2016-03-11).
	* apps/modbus/nuttx/portserial.c:  Was not returning an error
	  on failure to open the device driver.  From Olololshka kokoko
	  (2016-03-16).
	* apps/examples/sched_note:  Add a simple example to exercise
	  the scheduler instrumentation logic.  Kind of buggy right now
	  (2016-03-17).
	* apps/system/cdcacm, usbmsc, and composite, apps/examples/usbserial,
	  composite, usbterm:  Use new boardctl() instead of calling directly
	  in the OS when possible.  There are still a few bad OS calls for
	  USB device interfaces that do not yet have boardctl() commands
	  (2016-03-25).

7.16 2016-06-01 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/sdcard:  Remove the SD card application.  This
	  application violates OS/application interface rules and has been
	  moved to Obsoleted/apps/system/sdcard (2016-03-29).
	* apps/examples/alarm:  Add a simple test of the ALARM iotcl calls
	  of the RTC driver (2016-04-03).
	* apps/examples/nximage:  No configuration option to select
	  greyscale.
	* apps/canutils/uavcan: Update UAVCAN version.  From Paul Alexander

	* apps/examples/alarm: ioctl call was clobbering file descriptor
	  (2016-06-02).
	* apps/system/flash_eraseall:  Removed!  This logic violates the OS/
	  application interface and cannot be supported.  The old code can still
	  be found in the 'Obsoleted' repository (2016-06-03).
	* apps/fsutils/flash_eraseall: IOCTL wrapper for MDCIO_BULKERASE command
	  (2016-06-04).

	* apps/canutils/libuavcan: Fix for recent change to STM32 timer frequency
	  definiitions (2016-06-05).
	* Many files:  Change to the way that Kconfig files are generated in order
	  to better support reuse of the apps/ directory in NuttX products.  Changes
	  include: Make the full tree use wildcards make.defs, Add empty preconfig
	  rules to 'leaf' makefiles, Use directory.mk for recursive dir makefiles,
	  Individual app kconfig fixes, Recursive Kconfig autogeneration, Add
	  kconfig files for pcode and tiff, and fix a gitignore rule,  From
	  Sébastien Lorquet (2016-06-06).
	* apps/nshlib: Make NSH net-initialization be a configuration option. From
	  Marten Svanfeld (2016-06-09).

	  (2016-06-27).
	* apps/nshlib: 'ps' command now prints out the stack usage if stack
	  coloration is enabled.  From Frank Benkert (2016-06-30).
	* All inclusion of apps/ header files were removed from the nuttx/
	  repository. This caused a lot of reshuffling of logic:  binfmt pcode
	  support, usbmonitor is now a kernel thread, TZ/Olson database moved to
	  libc/zoneinfo (2016-06-29).
	* apps/include directory structure reorganized.  There are no longer any
	  header files in the apps/include/. directory.  Rather, sub-directories
	  were added to match the partitioning of apps/ sub-directories and the
	  header files were moved into the appropriate sub-directory.  This
	  change is intended to help with some changes be considered by
	  Sébastien Lorquet (2016-07-01).

	  pool.ntp.org as the NTP server; and reset the retry count upon success
	  -- more robust.  From David Alessio (2016-07-10).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_proccmds.c:  Recent enhancements to cmd_ps trips a
	  floating point exception if LIBC_FLOATINGPOINT is not defined (at
	  least on Cortex M4 w/ hardfloat).  Im using a buildroot gcc
	  configured to support Cortex-M4F and the hard float ABI, target files
	  are compiles with: -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -mfpu=fpv4-sp-d16
	  -mfloat-abi=hard.  Im not sure the best way to address this, but the
	  this chage is the first that comes to mind.  Note, I added the float
	  qualifier F after a few constants to prevent the compiler from
	  promoting the multiplication and division to double (expensive on
	  M4F) then demoting to single float for the store.  From David
	  Alessio (2016-07-10).
	* Call all includes fronm <apps/bla/bla.h> to "bla/bla.h". From
	  Sebastien Lorquet (2016-07-11).
	* Build System:  Add apps/include to include path in top-level

	  (2016-07-11).
	* apps/nshlib:  In ps command, don't show stack usage if
	  CONFIG_STACK_COLORATION is not enabled (2016-07-13).
	* apps/netutils/esp8266: In Kconfig, select ARCH_HAVE_NET when
	  NETUTILS_ESP8266 is selected.  This allows, among other things,
	  support for network debug output.  From Pierre-noel Bouteville
	  (2016-07-14).
	* apps/nshlib: PS Command: When Priority Inheritance is enabled, the
	  format of /proc/<PID>/status changes to show both the current priority
	  and the threads base priority.  This messes up the format of cmd_ps.
	  From David Alessio (2016-07-15).
	* apps/examples/pty_test: PTY test program.  From Alan Carvalho de Assis
	  (2016-07-15).
	* apps/examples/media: media example was intended to take either a
	  command line argument, or a compiled-in default value from config.
	  However, the default was ignored, leading to confusing error messages.
	  From ziggurat29 (2016-07-17).

	  the parser.  Noted by Freddie Chopin (2017-03-09).
	* apps/examples/hidkbd:  Remove call to arch_usbhost_initialize().
	  That is violation of the OS interfacing rules and will no longer be
	  supported.  USB host should be initialized as part of the normal
	  board bring-up logic as with any other devices and should not involve
	  illegal calls from applications into the OS (2017-03-09).
	* apps/examples/usbterm:  Removed because it is not very useful and
	  because it can be configured to use an illegal call into the OS
	  (2017-03-09).

	  loopback device, then use the server should use the configured client
	  IP address (2017-04-04).
	* Added support for set [{+|-}{e|x|xe|ex}] [<name> <value>].  Set the
	  'exit on error control' and/or 'print a trace' of commands when
	  parsing scripts in NSH.  The settinngs are in effect from the point
	  of exection, until they are changed again, or in the case of the init
	  script, the settings are returned to the default settings when it
	  exits.  Included child scripts will run with the parents settings and
	  changes made in the child script will effect the parent on return.
	  Use 'set -e' to enable and 'set +e' to disable (ignore) the exit
	  condition on commands. The default is -e. Errors cause script to
	  exit.  Use 'set -x' to enable and 'set +x' to disable (silence)
	  printing a trace of the script commands as they are ececuted. The
	  default is +x. No printing of a trace of script commands as they are
	  executed.  From David Sidrane (2017-04-05).
	* Print expanded variables if -x.  From David Sidrane (2017-04-05).

	  remain usable.  From Juha Niskanen (2017-04-12).
	* examples/hidkbd:  Add some missing configuration settings (2017-04-18).
	* NSH library: Fix open flags in nsh_codeccmd.c.  From Masayuki
	  Ishikawa (2017-04-19).
	* netlib and NSH: Add logic to set the IEEE802.15.4 PAN ID (2017-04-18).
	* wireless/ieee802154: Starts framing out iwpan tool, similar in
	  concept to wapi.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-04-20).
	* ieee802154: Move non-radio files from libradio to libutils.  Add
	  ieee802154_getpanid() (2017-04-21).
	* wireless/ieee802154:  Beginning of support for IEEE 802.15.4 MAC
	  library (2017-04-21).
	* wireless/ieee802154/libmac:  Finishes all defined MAC IOCTL helpers
	  (there are a few that are not defined) (2017-04-21).
	* netlib: Get and/or set PAN ID of IEEE 802.15.4 radio (2017-04-21).
	* wireless/ieee802154: libaudio and libmac need to return the correct
	  error codes (2017-04-22).
	* nshlib: nsh_netcmds.c should include netlib.h even if neither TCP nor
	  UDP are enabled (2017-04-25).
	* apps/wireless/wapi:  Correct an error in dependency generation
	  (2017-04-25).
	* examples: random: avoid stack overflows.  From Juha Niskanen
	  (2017-04-26).
	* wireless/wapi: Improve error reporting IOCTL failures (2017-04-26).
	* I need to look at the registers that are at or around 0xe000ef90.
	  Using mw and xd, I see that nsh does not support pointers greater
	  than 0x7fffffff.  A quick look at the source shows that the pointers
	  for those two commands are set with calls to strtol() rather than
	  strtoul().  Changing the two pointer-setting instances to strtoul()
	  fixes the problem, at least for my architecture/config.  From Ian
	  McAfee (2017-04-26).
	* NSH: Needs to include tftp.h if TFTP not disabled (2017-04-29).
	* netutils/dhcpc:  Make the network device name a configuration
	  option.  Was hardcoded to eth0 but may, instead, need to be wlan0
	  (2017-05-02).
	* nshlib/nsh_netinit.c: If IEEE802.11 selected use wlan0 instead of
	  eth0 for network device name (2017-05-02).
	* wireless/wext:  Add drivers_wext from the WPA supplicant; Integrate
	  into NSH.  From Simon Piriou (2017-05-02).
	* 6LoWPAN: Replace some Rime address naming with more consistent
	  short/exended address terminology (2017-05-04).
	* wireless/ieee802154:  Removes libradio to coincide with removal of
	  ioctl with radio. Moves all functionality from libradio to libmac.
	  From Anthony Merlino (2017-05-05).
	* wireless/wapi: wpa_driver_wext_associate() now accepts a
	  configuration parameter that can be used to specify the wireless
	  properties (2017-05-06).
	* nshlib:  NSH now has configuration options to select the
	  wireless properties.  It builds the configuration structure and
	  passes this to wpa_driver_wext_associate() so that it will set the
	  network as configured (2017-05-06).
	* Add platform files for nucleo-l452re and nucleo-l496zg.  From Juha
	  Niskanen (2017-05-08).
	* wireless/ieee802154:  Adds rxonidle attribute helpers.  From Anthony
	  Merlino (2017-05-08).
	* wireless/ieee802154:  Adds sniffer functionality back in to I8SAK
	  app.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-05-08).
	* NSH wireless setup:  Move call to nsh_associate().  It should be
	  possible to associate with an AP when DHCPC is disabled (2017-05-09).
	* Fix some calls to task_create():  argv[0] is the first parameter, not
	  the name of the task (2017-05-09).
	* wireless/ieee802154: Restructures i8sak app and adds blaster
	  functionality.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-05-09).
	* examples/configdata: add stacksize and priority.  From Juha Niskanen
	  (2017-05-10).
	* Bitbucket Issue 5:  I found an unexpected behavior in apps/
	  configuration generation. Adding external symbolic link in apps/
	  directory and using Make.defs for Kconfig generation, Kconfig file
	  has a wrong path in the source argument. It contains original dir
	  path outside of the source tree instead path to sub-directory in
	  apps/.  The problem is connected with make/system symbolic link path
	  resolution.  Corrected by a patch submitted by Artur Madrzak with
	  Issue 5 (2017-05-11).
	* Bitbucket Issue 5, apps build system: The previous patch wasn't
	  complete, it was just idea how to resolve issue.  Please, find
	  attached issue5.patch to resolve it. It can be applied on top current
	  apps/master. From Artur Madrzak (2017-05-12).
	* Fix the new can.h header location.  From Alan Carvalho de Assis
	  (2017-05-12).
	* Fix libcanard github download link to get it compiling correctly.
	  From Alan Carvalho de Assis (2017-05-12).
	* Fix to use the new canardInit() function.  From Alan Carvalho de
	  Assis (2017-05-12).
	* apps/platform:  Create gnu/ subdirectory that contains the one and
	  only GNU C++ initialization function.  Remove all other C++
	  initialization functions (2017-05-13).
	* Move up_cxxinitialize() prototype from nuttx/include/nuttx/arch.h to
	  apps/include/platform/cxxinitialize.h (2017-05-13).
	* apps/examples/nettest: Fix an error in pre-processor expression
	  (2017-05-13).
	* wireless/ieee802154: i8sak adds event handling from MAC char driver.
	  From Anthony Merlino (2017-05-16).
	* apps/examples/mtdpart: Prevent part array overflow.  mtdpart examples
	  create partions and allocate from 1 index not a 0 index to part[]
	  array. This cause buffer overflow for part array.  This change fixes
	  this problem.  From  EunBong Song (2017-05-17).
	* apps/examples/can:  Fix can example app to print data when
	  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_CAN_READ is defined.  From Alan Carvalho de Assis
	  (2017-05-17).
	* apps/: Make more globals static to avoid name clashes.  From Juha
	  Niskanen (2017-05-19).
	* Ensure netlib will not be broken when setip will not bring the
	  network up anymore.  From Sebastien Lorquet (2017-05-19).
	* DHCPC: Remove hard-coded interface device.  Now passed as a parameter
	  to dhcpc_open().  From Sebastien Lorquet (2017-05-19).
	* nshlib: Fix a resource leak in cmd_hexdump().  From Nobutaka
	  Toyoshima (2017-05-22).
	* wapi: add basic wapi_event_stream_extract implementation.  From Simon
	  Piriou (2017-05-21).
	* apps/system/dhcpc:  Add a command to renew or establish a lease on an
	  IPv4 address (2017-05-21).
	* apps/system/ntpc:  Add a command to start or stop the NTPC daemon
	  (2017-05-21).
	* apps/system/dhcpc: Add missing argument of fprintf (2017-05-21).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add a new option CONFIG_NSH_NETLOCAL that will suppress
	  some built in operations and will support manual configuration of a
	  wireless network (2017-05-21).
	* apps/system/ramtest: Make stacksize and priority conigurable
	  (2017-05-22).
	* The dedicated windows tool at tools/mkkconfig.bat uses $APPSDIR,
	  which is not a windows shell variable, and is left uninitialized, but
	  in fact should be the current directory.  From Sebastien Lorquet
	  (2017-05-22).

7.22 2017-09-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/composite: Update to apps/system/composite assocated with
	  big changes to the composite device logic.  From Frank Benkert
	  (2017-06-01).
	* wireless/ieee802154: Modifies i8 to support running various routines.
	  From Anthony Merlino (2017-06-14).
	* wireless/ieee802154: Rewrites i8sak to be test CLI for IEEE 802.15.4
	  MAC layer.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-06-14).
	* NSH network initialization: Fix some ieee 802.15.4 initialization
	  logic.  It should not set the saddr or panid; those cannot be
	  hard-coded but must come from the coordinator.  Re-factor a function
	  that has gotten too big and too complex.  Do not set the IP address
	  for 6loWPAN.  The 6loWPAN stack uses IP address that derive from the
	  ieee 802.15.4 addressing and cannot be (safely) configured by the
	  user (2017-06-17).
	* i8sak:  Missing newline in fprintf output (2017-06-18).
	* correct copy-paste typo in comments in composite_main.c  From Oleg
	  Evseev (2017-06-18).
	* Switches IEEE 802.15.4 based code to using byte arrays instead of
	  uint16_t values for short address and PAN ID.  From Anthony Merlino
	  (2017-06-19).
	* fix copy-paste typo in nsh_usbconsole.c.  From Oleg Evseev
	  (2017-06-19).
	* examples/udp: Add configurable network device name; Add option to
	  suppress network initialization which is not needed if started by NSH
	  or for 6LoWPAN (2017-06-19).
	* nshlib: fix size of 6LoWPAN extended address (2017-06-18).
	* examples/udp:  Fix registration as a built-in program; Change some
	  naming to make room for a second target.  Current one endpoint is the
	  target and one is the host.  This will (eventually) allow two targets
	  to be both endpoints of the test.  Change build so that both server
	  and client can be on a target, rather than one on the target one on
	  the host PC.  Server IP address may not be provided on the command
	  line (2017-06-19).
	* examples/smart: Fix some compilation errors.  Obviously this test has
	  not been used in a LONG time (2017-06-20).
	* examples/udp:  Port numbers need to be configurable to work with
	  6LoWPAN.  Need to bind the client socket to a port number.  This was
	  not required before so is a apparently a change in the UDP packet
	  dispatch logic (2017-06-20).
	* ieee802154: Changes to support beacon-enabled networks.  From Anthony
	  Merlino (2017-06-21).
	* wireless/ieee802154: Adds option to make it easy to send large frame
	  for testing purposes.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-06-21).
	* examples/udp:  Renaming some files to prevent name collision in
	  libapps.a.  Fix naming of a configuration setting (2017-06-23).
	* examples/nettest:  Renaming some files to prevent name collision in
	  libapps.a and to prepare to support target boards on both ends of the
	  test.  Separate out network initialization so that it may,
	  eventually, be used by both a target server and a target client.  Fix
	  client/server naming confusion; add command line option to select the
	  server address on the target.  Add support for both enpoints on
	  target boards vs. one on a target and one on the host PC
	  (2017-06-23).
	* system/dhcpc:  The DHCPC renew command did not build correctly due to
	  naming problems.  Noted by Masayuki Ishikawa (2017-06-23).
	* examples/nettest: Fixes for building with loopback device again after
	  the last changes (2017-06-23).
	* examples/nettest:  The send buffer size is now a configuration option
	  (2017-06-24).
	* examples/udp and examples/nettest: Fix some naming collisions;
	  examples/nettest:  Fix some build issues with two targets
	  (2017-06-25).
	* ieee802154: Adds scan command.   From Anthony Merlino (2017-06-25).
	* ieee802154: Minor fix to setup logic for i8sak.  From Anthony Merlino
	  (2017-06-25).
	* ieee802154: start of scan/beacon-enabled network.  From Anthony
	  Merlino (2017-06-26).
	* netutils/telnetc:  This a port of libtelnet to NuttX (2017-06-26).
	* system/telnet:  Add Telnet Chat deamon and and client from libtelent
	  (2017-06-26).
	* NSH library:  Add a Telnetd command.  This is needed when network
	  initialization is deferred.  In that case, telnet daemon cannot be
	  started until the network is finally initialized.  The telnetd
	  command was added just for that case:  So that the telnet daemon can
	  be started from the NSH command line after the network is configured
	  (2017-06-26).
	* revise some of the state handling in the previous commit
	  (2017-06-26).
	* system/telnet: POLL must not be disabled in configuration.  Telnet
	  client port argument is no optional (2017-06-27).
	* netutils/telnetd and users of telnetd:  Add support for IPv6
	  (2017-06-27).
	* ieee802154/i8sak: Adds coordinfo command allowing you to poll various
	  attributes related to the coordinator.  From Anthony Merlino
	  (2017-06-27).
	* i8sak:  Need to increment the next_saddr after each successful
	  association (2017-06-29).
	* i8sak:  Add a option to retry on failures to the assoc command
	  (2017-06-29).
	* apps/examples/thttpd:  Remove the netstats demo.  This depends on an
	  illegal function call and cannot be supported.  That example could be
	  replaced with logic that uses the procfs network entries as was done
	  for NSH which had the same issue.  But I am too lazy to implement
	  that (2017-07-01).
	* i8sak: Adds reset command to reset the MAC layer.  Adds option to
	  assoc command -t to specify how long to wait for a response from the
	  Coordinator.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-07-01).
	* Eliminate a warning when both Ethernet and 6LoWPAN are enabled;
	  improve some naming (2017-05-02).
	* ieee802154: Adds reset command, adds resp_waittime option to
	  associate, and a few other minor tweaks.  From Anthony
	  Merlino(2017-07-02).
	* NSH library: Fix build break in nsh_command.c with IPv4/IPv6 dual
	  stack.  From Masayuki Ishikawa (2017-07-04).
	* apps/examples/keypadtest: REMOVED and warehoused in the Obsoleted
	  repository.  This was just a bad clone of apps/examples/hidkbd for a
	  keypad driver that was removed years ago.  It also uses illegal
	  function calls into the OS.  So it has no purpse:  It is
	  redundant, it uses illegal interfaces, and is a test for non-existent
	  code (2017-07-04).
	* tools/mkkconfig.bat: Use %cd% instead of %~dp0 for usage of APPSDIR
	  in this batch file (2017-07-05).
	* system/dhcpc: Fix warning about renew_main.o appear twice in rule
	  (2017-07-05).
	* tools/mkkconfig.bat:  Remove quotes in echo.  These were begin
	  Echo'ed and generating double quots in the output.  From Jeff
	  (2017-07-05).
	* Windows build fixes:  tools/mkkconfig.bat - switch APPSDIR path to
	  use forward slashes for kconfig-frontends. interpreters/ficl -
	  Reorder some targets that causes GNUwin32 make to behave badly.  From
	  Jeff (2017-07-06).
	* platform/Makefile: More attempts to fix for Windows native build.
	  Backslash as a delimiter causes problems in pattern subsitutions
	  (2017-07-06).
	* apps/examples/ipforward: Add beginning of an IP forwarding example
	  using only TUN devices.  Test extended to test forwarding of ICMPv6
	  multicast messages.  Completes code for apps/examples/ipforward.
	  Still untested (2017-07-09).
	* apps/netutils/tftpc: Missing header file causes errors in some
	  configurations (2017-07-10).
	* Socket I/F: Cleanup for good CONFIG_NET_PKT build (2017-07-14).
	* netutils/netlib:  Fixes to work when only USRSOCK is enabled
	  (2017-07-14).
	* apps/system/composite:  Remove CDC/ACM and MSC configuration logic.
	  This belongs in the OS composite initialization.  Add and argument so
	  that you can select the USB composite configuration to be attached.
	  Restore USB tracing; remove unused field in a structure.  Remove
	  configuration settings that are no longer used.  Fix configuration
	  selecting.. was setting the port number, not the configure ID.  Also
	  add a configuration option to select the default configuration
	  (2017-07-15).
	* apps/system/composite: Add a configuration option to the boardctl()
	  calls to support multiple composite device configurations dynamically
	  (2017-07-16).
	* i8sak: Minor formatting fix.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-07-10).
	* wireless/ieee802154/i8sak: Minor setting changes.  From Anthony
	  Merlino (2017-07-17).
	* ieee802154/i8sak:  Adds command to trigger regdump of radio.  From
	  Anthony Merlino (2017-07-18).
	* apps/system/composite:  Remove references to USBMSC.  There still
	  dependencies on CDC/ACM in the serial USB trace output.  That really
	  should be removed (2017-08-21).
	* netutils/ftpc:  Fix some memory leaks.  From Boris Astardzhiev
	  (2017-07-27).
	* Implement powermonitor example for ltc4151 current and voltage
	  monitor.  From Giorgio Groß (2017-07-28).
	* NSH: Misc changes needed for PktRadio support (2017-07-30).
	* examples/nettest/:  Loopback option should be available in Kconfig
	  for PktRadio (2017-08-01).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  Add support for PktRadio IOCTL commands
	  (2017-08-02).
	* NSH library: Extend ifconfig command so that it can set variable
	  length packet radio addresss (2017-08-02).
	* netutils/netlib: Fix netlib_nodaddrconv() so that its return type is
	  the same as other address conversion functions.  NSH: Correct parsing
	  of ifconfig so that you can specify the HW address without specifying
	  the IP address (2017-08-02).
	* apps/examples/udp:  Enable testing with the broadcast address
	  (2017-08-08).
	* Remove references to obsoleted CONFIG_NETDEV_MULTINIC and
	  CONFIG_NETDEV_MULILINK (2017-08-08).
	* NSH library:  Update addroute and delroute command.  The would
	  support either IPv4 or IPv6, but not both.  Allow expression of the
	  netmask in IPv4 CIDR or IPv6 slash notation.  This really reduces the
	  pain of using the commands, especially for IPv6 (2017-08-10).
	* NSH Library: Add a route command that will dump the content of
	  routing table (2017-08-11).
	* apps/netutils/tftpc depends on CONFIG_NET_IPv4 (2017-08-12).
	* Application.mk:  Add the .PRECIOUS target to prevent libapps.a from
	  being deleted when the make is interrupted (2017-08-12).
	* apps/examples/nximage: Remove unused global variable (2017-08-12).
	* netutils/thttpd: Fix a malformed if condition detected by GCC 6.x.x
	  (2017-08-12).
	* All Makefiles:  Add .PRECIOUS: apps/libapps.a to every Makefile.
	  Hopefully this will end awkward problems when you Control-C out of a
	  build and libapps.a is deleted (2017-08-13).
	* The last change added .PRECIOUS: $(BIN) to everyway Makefile in hopes
	  the libapps.a will not be deleted on Control-C (unproven so far).
	  However, $(BIN) may contain back slashes in some build platforms and
	  that causes problems for make:  It can't handle the backslashes in
	  the .PRECIOUS dependency list.  $(BIN) replaced with ../../libapp.a,
	  where the number of ../ depends on the depth of the Makefile in the
	  apps/ source tree (2017-08-13).
	* netutils/netlib: Add a helper to decode short addresses
	  (2017-08-18).
	* apps/examples/pf_ieee802154:  Add for testing PF_IEEE802154 sockets.
	  Add PANID to command line options; Cannot bind to address zero...
	  There is no counterpart to INADDR_ANY for these radios (not now at
	  least) (2017-08-19).
	* Changes to netlib and nsh so that you build build with PF_IEEE802154
	  enabled and 6LoWPAN disabled (2017-08-20).
	* netutils/netlib: If only PF_IEEE802154 socket family is enabled, then
	  must use SOCK_DGRAM (2017-08-21).
	* NSH:  Add conditions so that ifconfig and ifup will not be disabled
	  if we are using only PF_IEEE802154 (2017-08-21).
	* dhcpd: Prevent buffer overflow in dhcpd_addoption.  offset represents
	  distance from start of option buffer.  So this should be changed
	  current option pointer minus start of buffer.  From EunBong Song
	  (2017-08-25).
	* apps/examples/nsh: Remove APPNAME, PRIORITY, and STACKSIZE settings
	  from Makefile to avoid showing nsh in Builtin Apps.  From Masayuki
	  Ishikawa (2017-08-26).
	* examples: add DAC example.  From Juha Niskanen (2017-09-1).

7.23 2017-12-04 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* examples/ostest: sem_open() now returns SEM_FAILED in the event of a
	  failure (2017-09-08).
	* examples/adc: Fix g_adcstate.count initialization.  From Masayuki
	  Ishikawa (2017-09-11).
	* examples/fb:  Flesh out the framebuffer driver test.  examples/fb:
	  Add a simple test for the framebuffer character driver.  This initial
	  commit just verfies some interfaces and initialization logic.  Still
	  need to add to graphics update logic (2017-09-12).
	* Rename CONFIG_AUDIO_DEVICES to CONFIG_DRIVERS_AUDIO to conform better
	  to the evolving configuration naming standard (2017-09-12).
	* examples/fb:  Extend test to include 1-bpp monochrome (2017-09-13).
	* Added a simple reader example for the LIS3DSH acceleration sensor on
	  STM32F4Discovery.  From Florian Olbrich (2017-09-14).
	* wireless/ieee802154/i8sak: Adds socket interface support. You can now
	  use both socket or char driver to control the MAC layer.  From Anthony
	  Merlino (2017-09-15).
	* wireless/ieee802154/i8sak:  Fixes several bugs.  Adds sniffer port
	  option and a few other get/set parameters.  From Anthony Merlino
	  (2017-09-15).
	* i8sak: Updates README to include details about socket interface and
	  new addressing setup and fixes warning.  Fix warning about
	  uninitialized variable.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-09-15).
	* apps/examples/apa102: Add a Rainbow example for APA102 LED Strip.
	  From Alan Carvalho de Assis (2017-09-18).
	* netutils/netlib:  Add netlib_ipv6adaptor() and netlib_ipv4adaptor()
	  (2017-09-19).
	* netlib_ipv[4|6]adaptor: Add a check to handle the case where the
	  network device configuration changed asynchronously and the second IOCTL
	  returns more data than the allocated buffer (2017-09-20).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  Add helpers for reading the routing table:
	  netlib_read_ipv4route() and netlib_read_ipv6route() (2017-09-20).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  Add new utilities netlib_ipv[4|6]router() that
	  can be used to determine the IP address of a router that would be used
	  some some destination IP address that is not locally accessible
	  (2017-09-20).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  netlib_ipv[4|6]adaptor() will now use the new
	  routing table interfaces if they are available:  If the destination IP
	  address does not correspond to the network served by any device, then
	  the address of the router that should get us to the correct sub-net is
	  is determined.  Then the network adaptor that can communicate with the
	  that router has the IP address that will returned (2017-09-20).
	* apps/examples/flowc:  Add a simple test of serial hardware flow control
	  (2017-09-23).
	* apps/examples/qencode: The QENCODER name was changed to
	  SENSORS_QENCODER fix it here.  From Alan Carvalho de Assis (2017-09-24).
	* nshlib/nsh_parse.c: Avoid truncating the strcmp result into a unsigned
	  char variable.  nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c: Check for valid hostip before
	  using it.  nshlib/nsh_ddcmd.c: Fix resouce leak when 'if=' or 'of='
	  params are repeated in the command line.  For example:
	    - dd if=/dev/null if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null or
	    - dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/zero of=/dev/null
	  From Bruno Herrera (2017-09-25).
	* nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c: Fix a compilation error when IPv4/IPv6 dual
	  stack is enabled.  From Masayuki Ishikawa (2017-09-26).
	* apps/examples/flowc:  Add a delay between received packets in order to
	  force input flow control (2017-09-26).
	* apps/examples/flowc: Fix some errors in receiver's verificationg
	  logic.  Add a 'canned' data file so that we don't need to deal with the
	  sender program; we can just 'cat' the canned data file (2017-09-26).
	* apps/examples/flowc:  Add some syslog output to flush the syslog
	  interrupt buffer (2017-09-27).
	* apps/examples/flowc: Small improvement to break line if more than 80 .
	  were printed.  From Alan Carvalho de Assis (2017-09-27).
	* apps/examples:  In elf and nxflat examples, remove low-level
	  interfaces and replace with call to exec() (2017-10-02).
	* examples/elf and nxff: Won't build with CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL because
	  the interface exec() is not available in that configuration.  Also,
	  remove a stray comma and a stray semacolon in examples/pty_test/Kconfig
	  and examples/random/Kconfig (2017-10-06).
	* Add powerled driver example.  From Mateusz Szafoni (2017-10-08).
	* examples/ostest:  Works around a bug in printf() when cancellation
	  points are enabled.  printf() is a cancellation point because it calls
	  write().  This is correct according to OpenGroup.org.  However, printf
	  holds the stdio library semaphore when it is canceled and this leaves
	  the semaphore in a bad state.  No fix for the printf bug yet (2017-10-10).
	* examples/ina219: A simple infinite loop that polls the INA219 sensor
	  and displays the measurements.  From Sebastien Lorquet (2017-10-11).
	* examples/ostest: Extend cancellation test to make sure that cancelable
	  threads waiting on a message queue or on a signal can be canceled
	  (2017-10-12).
	* netutils/ftpc:  Fix some crazy comparisons to determine is a file is
	  an absolute path.  Noted by Anthony Merlino (2017-10-13).
	* examples/nx:  The NX example no longer supports single user mode
	  (2017-10-14).
	* examples/nxtext:  The nxtext example no longer supports single user
	  mode (2017-10-14).
	* examples/lcdrw:  Remove this example.  It violates the portable OS
	  interface and cannot be retained (2017-10-14).
	* graphics/traveler:  Restore most of what was removed in the previous
	  commit.  That non-standard logic is currently needed by the simulation.
	  It should be replaced with use of a framebuffer driver.  No longer
	  supports single user graphics mode (2017-10-14).
	* examples/nxhello now supports only multiuser mode (2017-10-14).
	* examples/nximage now supports only multiuser mode (2017-10-14).
	* system/lm75:  Fix a naming error in a dependency.  From Alan Carvalho
	  de Assis (2017-10-14).
	* examples/nxlines now supports only multiuser mode (2017-10-14).
	* exampls/nxhello:  Increase the amount of time that the text is
	  displayed before erasing it (2017-10-15).
	* Add -n samples to lm75 app and replace Centigrade with Celsius.  From
	  Alan Carvalho de Assis (2017-10-15).
	* graphics/traveler: Convert to use the framebuffer driver (2017-10-16).
	* examples/alarm: add options for reading alarm value and canceling it.
	  From Juha Niskanen (2017-10-17).
	* apps/fsutils/mkfatfs:  Move mkfatfs from the OS to here.  Not fully
	  integrated on the intial commit (2017-10-20).
	* apps/examples/adps9960:  Add ADPS-9960 example.  From Alan Carvalho de
	  Assis (2017-10-23).
	* This commit eliminates the ping command from NSH and replaces it with
	  a ping 'built-in' at apps/system/ping.  The original NSH version of ping
	  violated the portable POSIX interface and, hence, had to be removed.
	  The new system/ping command uses the new IPPROTO_ICMP AF_INET datagram
	  sockets to implement ping (2017-10-23).
	* apps/system/ping6:  Use inet_ntop() to improve the appearance of the
	  ping6 IPv6 address output.  Fix a typo and also a place where = used
	  when == intended.  This commit removes the ping6 command from NSH and
	  replaces it with the apps/system/ping6 built-in command.  The NSH ping6
	  command had to be removed because it violated the portable POSIX OS
	  interface.  The apps/system/ping6 command uses the sem-standard
	  IPPROTO_ICMP6 socket interface (2017-10-24).
	* apps/nshlib:  ifconfig improvements.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-10-24).
	* nshlib:  mount command no long uses the non-standard OS interface
	  foreach_mountpoint().  Now simply cats /proc/fs/mount when there are no
	  arguments to the mount command (2017-10-26).
	* nshlib:  df command no long uses the non-standard OS interface
	  foreach_mountpoint().  Now simply cats /proc/fs/blocks or /proc/fs/usage
	  (2017-10-26).
	* Fix parsing of empty strings when CONFIG_NSH_CMDPARMS is not defined.
	  Problem noted by Juha Niskanen (2017-10-27).
	* apps/canutils/libobd2:  Add libobd2 for NuttX.  From Alan Carvalho de
	  Assis (2017-10-28).
	* apps/examples/obd2:  Add OBD2 example application.  From Alan Carvalho
	  de Assis (2017-10-28).
	* include/netutils/netlib.h:  Broaden socket definitions of previous
	  commit.  Add definitions needed when only local Unix domain sockets are
	  supported (2017-10-30).
	* apps/examples/userfs:  Add a test case for verifying UserFS
	  (2017-10-31).
	* Fixed i2ctool write operation in `no restart` mode (flag `-n`).  It
	  seems that I2C driver has changed a bit since i2ctool was written, so
	  now i2ctool sends repeated start even if `no restart` flag (-n) was
	  passed to it.  From Dmitriy Linikov (2017-11-01).
	* Fixed misprint in cmd_wget.  From Dmitriy Linikov (2017-11-01).
	* apps/examples/userfs:  Fix bad logic in test stat() implementation
	  (2017-11-01).
	* i8sak: Changes 'notif' to 'primitive' corresponding to the changes in
	  the Kernel.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-11-01).
	* Adds i8shark, a sniffer "adapter" that captures all 802.15.4 traffic,
	  packages it into a Wireshark ZEP packet, and sends it to a host running
	  Wireshark  From Anthony Merlino (2017-11-01).
	* apps/examples/userfs:  Fix check for open with write+append mode
	  (2017-11-01).
	* apps/fsutils/mkfatfs:  When fsutils/mkfats was split off from the
	  operating system, there were a few dangling things left.  Some
	  references to functions in the OS (which are not available in the
	  protected and kernel modes) and several types and function prototeypes
	  that don't exist is apps/fsutils/mkfatfs (2017-11-02).
	* Fixed the compilation of nsh_routecmds.c, broken after commit
	  6b9d23c6aa0247c701acf1d0ecdaececf546342a.  From Dmitriy Linikov
	  (2017-11-03).
	* include/netutils/netlib.h:  In order to avoid pre-processing warnings,
	  NETLIB_SOCK_FAMILY must always be assigned a value, even if there is no
	  real meaning value for it (2017-11-03).
	* i8sak: Channel setting is now saved locally, so when performing a
	  startpan or assoc, the channel previously set is still used, even though
	  the MAC layer gets reset.  Also fixes a few build issues.  From Anthony
	  Merlino (2017-11-03).
	* examples: add SMPS driver example.  From Mateusz Szafoni (2017-11-05).
	* smps, powerled examples: fix floating point format in printf.  From
	  Mateusz Szafoni (2017-11-05).
	* apps/examples/userfs:  Handle the O_TRUNC open flag.  Fixes a bug with
	  double freeing open data when dup'ed files are closed (2017-11-06).
	* apps/examples/ltdc:  Remove apps/examples/ltdc.  It violates the
	  portable POSIX interface by calling directly into OS code (2017-11-06).
	* FTP: Adds support for IPv6 and fixes various transfer issues.   From
	  Anthony Merlino (2017-11-06).
	* netutils/ftpc:  Eliminate warnings about types of inputs to
	  netlib_ipv4adaptr() and about ftp_cmd_pasv() being defined but not used
	  (2017-11-12).
	* apps/system/free:  Removed because it violates the portable POSIX OS
	  interface (2017-11-13).
	* apps/nshlib:  The free commands no longer used mallinfo() to get the
	  state of the use heap.  Two reasons:  That is not useful information in
	  the kernel build.  And (2) there are other memory resources of interest
	  in other configurations such as the Kernel heap in PROTECTED and KERNEL
	  builds, and the prog mem uses when FLASH is used to hold modifiable
	  data.  The free command has been extended to just dump the content of
	  procfs entries and to include all of these other memory resources of the
	  procfs entries are available (2017-11-13).
	* apps/nshlib:  Big simplification of last change.  /proc/kmm, umm, and
	  progmem have been replaced with a single procfs file called
	  /proc/meminfo.  The NSH free command now degenerates to a simple dump of
	  /proc/meminfo (2017-11-13).
	* apps/graphics/pdcurs34:  This commit brings the basic public domain
	  pdcurses library into NuttX.  This library is complete but not yet
	  usuable because it still requires the NuttX interfacing code needed hook
	  pdcurses into the NuttX graphics drivers.  Also test cases are needed to
	  verify the pdcurses integration (2017-11-17).
	* apps/examples/pdcurses:  Bring in pdcurses demos and make them conform
	  to the NuttX coding style (not yet hooked into the build system)
	  (2017-11-18).
	* apps/graphics/pdcurs34:  Extend configuration to select the font size
	  (2017-11-18).
	* apps/example/pdcurses:  Add logic to build one of the several pdcurses
	  demo/test programs (2017-11-18).
	* apps/graphics/pdcurs34/nuttx:  Completes first cut at framebuffer
	  rendering logic.  Add NuttX framebuffer color managment and beginning of
	  some rendering logic (2017-11-19).
	* apps/examples/pdcurses/: Fix a few more bugs found in testing;  Brings
	  in the remaining pdcurses demo programs (2017-11-19).
	* apps/graphics/pdcurs34:  Add support for discrete joystick input.
	  This is sufficient to get through all menuing tests that do not require
	  text input (2017-11-22).
	* apps/graphics/pdcurs34:  Add support for greylevels vs. RGB.  Define
	  pdc_color_t based on pixel depth, not on specific color format.  Need to
	  set the global COLORS or else all displays on monochrome (2017-11-22).
	* i8shark:  Adds CONFIG_IEEE802154_I8SHARK_XBEE_APPHDR option to remove
	  XBee's application header before sending to Wireshark. This option will
	  corrupt any traffic received that does not include this application
	  header.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-11-22).
	* apps/wireless/ieee802154/i8sak: Adds ability to get/set rxonidle
	  setting for MAC layer.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-11-xx).
	* apps/examples/fb:  Fix calculation of a mask value (2017-11-22).
	* NxWidgets:  Move from apps/NxWidgts to apps/graphics/NxWidgets
	  (2017-11-24).
	* apps/examples/pdcurses:  Add a very simple example that just shows the
	  entire character set (7-bit only).  It adapts to the size of the
	  framebuffer and, hence, can be used with very tiny displays.  In fact it
	  looks really dumb on big displays (2017-11-24).
	* apps/examples/fb:  Add a small delay between updating each rectangular
	  region (2017-11-25).
	* apps/examples: CONFIG_QENCODER was renamed to CONFIG_SENSORS_QENCODER:
	  update README.txt.  From Fabio D'Urso (2017-11-25).
	* apps/graphics/pdcurs34: Initial steps to support less than 8-pixel
	  fonts on less than 8-bit display.  Calculation of font buffer stride
	  must depend on the configured BPP.  Add first cut at function to copy a
	  font into the font buffer; Make better use of macros to reduce code
	  complexity (2017-11-27).
	* apps/examples/nunchuck: Add Nunchuck example application.  From Alan
	  Carvalho de Assis (2017-11-28).
	* apps/graphics/pdcurs34:  Correct logic that sets the font buffer to
	  the background color for the case of BPP < 8 (2017-11-29).
	* apps/examples/pdcurses:  Clean up charset example so that the display
	  geomtry  is better on very wide displays (wide with respect to the width
	  of a character) (2017-11-30).

7.24 2018-03-02 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* i8shark: Fixes special XBee compensation by purposely chopping off the
	  FCS.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-12-08).
	* nxplayer: Add support for http streaming in nxplayer.  From Masayuki
	  Ishikawa (2017-12-19).
	* Adds 'setlogmask' application that allows you to set the syslog
	  priority via a simple command.  From Anthony Merlino (2017-12-19).
	* apps/netutils/ftpc:  Fix some cornercases that could cause FTP to
	  access past the end of valid data.  From Gregory Nutt (2017-12-21).
	* examples/userfs: Add truncate() support for userfs.  From Gregory Nutt
	  (2018-01-03).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add support for a truncate command.  This will be used
	  to test the new ftruncate file system support.  From Gregory Nutt
	  (2018-01-04).
	* nshlib/nsh_telnetd.c: Add support for telnet character mode.  From
	  Masayuki Ishikawa (2018-01-10).
	* apps/nshlib: Add support for '-n' option to the echo command.  From
	  Masayuki Ishikawa (2018-01-10).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add irqinfo command.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-01-12).
	* apps/system/usbmsc: Added Kconfig options to configure write
	  protection for each LUN.  From Fabio D'Urso (2018-01-14).
	* apps/examples/lvgldemo:  Add lvgldemo example.  From Alan Carvalho
	  de Assis (2018-01-16).
	* apps/graphics/littlevgl:  Add littlevgl library.  From Alan Carvalho
	  de Assis (2018-01-16).
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  Eliminate BOARDIOC_TSCTEST_SETUP.  From
	  Gregory Nutt (2018-01-17).
	* apps/examples/lvgldemo: Can no longer call boardctl() to initialize
	  graphics hardware if needed.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-01-18).
	* apps/netutils/netlib: Add default route in netlib_set_dripv4addr().
	  From Masayuki Ishikawa (2018-01-19).
	* system/stackmonitor:  Re-design the stack monitor so that it does not
	  make forbidden calls directly into the OS, breaking the portable POSIX
	  OS interface.  It now properly uses the PROCFS file system to glean
	  information about stack usage.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-01-20).
	* apps/nshlib:  Fix compile error when CONFIG_NSH_DISABLESCRIPT is not
	  defined.  The field np_flags does not exist if scripting is disabled.
	  From Gregory Nutt (2018-01-22).
	* apps/examples/veml6070:  Add VEML6070 Application Example.  From Alan
	  Carvalho de Assis (2018-01-28).
	* examples/bmp180: Add BMP180 application example.  From Alan Carvalho
	  de Assis (2018-02-04).
	* apps/graphics/ft80x:  Add the FTDU FT80x GUI support library.
	  Consists of some dispaly list helpers, audio helpers, touch helpers, RAM
	  access, register access etc.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-02-18).
	* apps/examples/ft80x:  Add a test of the FT80x based on FTDI
	  SampleApp.  Includes tests of GPU primitives and graphics co-processor
	  commands From Gregory Nutt (2018-02-18).
	* apps/graphics/ft80x and apps/examples/ft80x:  Fix a few compile-relate
	  issues introduced with last merge.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-02-19).
	* apps/examples/ft80x:  Add a few more demos of GPU primitive
	  operations.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-02-19).
	* Added ECANCELED condition to DEBUGASSERT-s checking sem_wait result.
	  From Dmitriy Linikov (2018-02-20).

7.25 2018-06-03 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/netutils/tftpc:  This commit modifies the TFTP client functions to
	  use a data read/write callback instead of a file.  This allows TFTP to
	  write to arbitrary destination (in my case, a MTD device - for firmware
	  update).  Two new functions are introduced for this, named tftpget_cb and
	  tftpput_cb. They are just made of most of the existing code.  The
	  previously existing tftpget/tftpput functions are now wrappers on the new
	  ones, with callbacks that read/write from files, so my modifications are
	  backwards compatible with existing applications, eg the associated nsh
	  commands dont need to be changed.  From Sebastien Lorquet (2018-03-09).
	* apps/examples/ft80x:  Fix some size calculations.  Add option to disable
	  primitive tests... just too boring to have to watch over and over again.
	  Fix a typo in backlight fade logic; Fix error in formatted display light
	  debug dump output.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-03-09).
	* apps/examples/ft80x:  Text is handled by the coprocessor and, hence, must
	  use RAM_CMD, not RAM_DL.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-03-09).
	* apps/examples/ft80x:  Fix some errors in co-processor demos.  Correct an
	  error in the spinner demo.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-03-10).
	* apps/examples/netloop:  Update network loopback example so that it can be
	  used to test TCP KeepAlive.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-03-12).
	* apps/system/stackmonitor:  Fix comparison between pointer and zero
	  character constant.  From Juha Niskanen (2018-03-13).
	* apps/system and wireless:  Applications should use the standard clock()
	  interface, not the internal NuttX clock_systimer() interface.  From
	  Gregory Nutt (2018-03-14).
	* apps/examples/lzf:  Add the test case from Marc Alexander Lehmann's
	  LIBLZF3.6 librrary  From Boris Astardzhiev (2018-03-14).
	* apps/examples/lzf:  lzf_compress() now expects the hash table as user
	  allocated input parmeter rather than declaring the huge array on the
	  stack.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-03-15).
	* apps/examples/lzf:  unlzf and lzcat are not supported.  From Gregory Nutt
	  (2018-03-15).
	* apps/examples/lzf: Fix name composition and set defaults early in main.
	  From Boris Astardzhiev (2018-03-15).
	* apps/examples/nsh and posix_spawn:  Must not call exec_setsymtab()
	  directly.  That is a non-POSIX internal OS interface.  From Gregory Nutt
	  (2018-03-16).
	* apps/system/lzf:  Move the LZF tool from apps/examples/ to apps/system.
	  From Gregory Nutt (2018-03-16).
	* apps/system/lzf:  Don't build the LZF tool if the LZF library is not
	  enabled.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-03-16).
	* apps/system/lzf: Refactor so that the user is no longer required to
	  generate the LZF header  From Boris Astardzhiev (2018-03-16).
	* apps/system/lzf:  (1) The maximum block size is now configuration setting
	  in order to give finer control over memory usage.  (2) The
	  compression/decompression buffers have been moved out the stack and are
	  now global variables.  This eliminates the need to set large stack sizes
	  to use this utility.  (3) Added semaphore protection of all global
	  variables for the case of the FLAT or PROTECTED builds.  Unlike the
	  KERNEL build, the same global variables will be used by each instance of
	  the LZF utility.  If you want thread safety, then you must either (a)
	  serialize all access to the global variables, or (b) pack the global
	  variables into a structure and allocate that structure on each execution
	  of lzf_main().  From Gregory Nutt (2018-03-17).
	* apps/examples/cromfs:  Add an example of how to build a CROMFS file
	  system image.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-03-20).
	* Remove canutils/libuavcan and examples/uavcan.  libuavcan has not built
	  for a year or so.  The basic problem is that as NuttX advances, the old
	  frozen version of libuavcan has become absolute because it violates the
	  portable POSIX OS interface.  No one is maintaining the port so there is
	  no alternative but to remove it.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-03-23).
	* apps/examples/elf:  Extend the ELF program module demo so that you can
	  use compressed ELF programs with CROMFS.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-03-24).
	* apps/examples/elf:  Use strip command to make ELF binaries MUCH smaller.
	  Add an option to strip debug symbols even if the debug symbols are
	  enabled in the base code.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-03-25).
	* apps/wireless/bluetooth/btsak:  Add a Bluetooth debugt tool.  From
	  Gregory Nutt (2018-04-02).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  Various fixes needed to get a clean netlib build
	  with Bluetooth only.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-04-03).
	* apps/examples/cc3000:  Remove the CC3000 example.  From Alan Carvalho de
	  Assis (2018-04-04).
	* apps/examples/smps:  Fix typos in Kconfig.  All power, voltage, current
	  values were strings with no default.  I assume they should be 'int' with
	  what default?  From Gregory Nutt (2018-04-04).
	* examples/powerled:  Add arch initialization; examples/smps: fixes in some
	  printf and in Kconfig  From Mateusz Szafoni (2018-04-07).
	* apps/examples/adxl372_test and lxm330spi_test:  Add ADXL372 and LSM330
	  tests.  From Bob Feretich (2018-04-09).
	* apps/examples/max31855: Add an example to read multiple max31855 sensors
	  From Tiago Almeida (2018-04-09).
	* apps/examples/ostest:  Do not call AIO test without
	  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_OSTEST_AIO  From Juha Niskanen (2018-04-11).
	* apps/examples/nxdemo:  Add nxdemo application  From Alan Carvalho de
	  Assis (2018-04-28).
	* apps/system/embedlog:  Support for embedlog data loggin package from
	  https://embedlog.kurwinet.pl/  From Michal Lyszczek (2018-05-06).
	* nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add the mkfatfs -r option which can be used to
	  specify the number of entries in the FAT12/FAT16 root directory.  From
	  Boris Astardzhiev (2018-05-11).
	* apps/system/zmodem:  Add an option to enable hardware flow control via
	  termios.  Fix Makefile.host.  It was broken when zmodem.h was moved to
	  apps/include/system.  Fix an incompatibility with the way that CRCs are
	  calculated.  Allow stack size and priority to be configured.  From
	  Gregory Nutt (2018-05-27).
	* apps/system/zmodem:  Call tcflush() before closing the serial port.  This
	  is necessary because that close operation may hang if hardware flow
	  control is enabled.  Consider this scenario:  After the host sz runs on
	  the host, it exits and leaves CTS high.  The target rz completes, and
	  tries to close the serial port.  But if there is buffered Tx data, then
	  the close will hang when it tries to drain the buffered Tx data since
	  there is no where it can go.  tcflush() discards the buffered data and
	  permits the close to continue.  There is additional logic in
	  nuttx/drivers/serial needed to work with this.  From Gregory Nutt
	  (2018-05-27).
	* apps/, Various Makefiles:  Fix mixed references to nuttx/lib.  These need
	  to be changed to nuttx/staging.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-05-30).
	* Various fixes necessary to build the simulator under MSYS1.  From Gregory
	  Nutt (2018-05-31).
	* apps/Makefile and platform/Makefile:  At clean_context targets that are
	  now invoked from the main nuttx/Makefile.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-05-31).

	* apps/netutils/ftpc:  Fix handling of url-encoded strings  From
	  Dmitriy Linikov (2018-06-04).
	* apps/examples/i2sloop:  Add i2sloop application.  This application
	  can be used to test I2S loopback like:  nsh> i2sloop &
	  From Masayuki Ishikawa (2018-06-06).
	* nsh_parse.c: fix 'while' and 'until' loop condition
	  The loop condition logic was inverted:  while true; do echo "test";
	  done
	  would exit immediately, while using 'until' would stay in the loop.
	  This is the opposite of how it is supposed to work.
	  The reason is that 'state' was set wrong because 'whilematch' is a
	  bool.  From Beat Küng (2018-06-06).
	* examples: Adds example to test framebuffer overlay  From Marco Krahl
	  (2018-06-06).
	* apps/examples/ostest:  Signal handling tests should use the same
	  configurable stack size as used in other tests, not
	  PTHREAD_STACK_DEFAULT.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-06-07).
	* apps/system/taskset:  Add taskset command for SMP systems.  This
	  command can be used to retrieve or set a process's CPU affinity.
	  For example,

	    nsh> taskset -p 4
	    pid 4's current affinity mask: 2

	    nsh> taskset -p 3 4
	    pid 4's current affinity mask: 3

	    nsh> taskset -p 1 busyloop &

	  From Masayuki Ishikawa (2018-06-08).
	* apps/gpsutils/minmea:  Include wchar.h in minmea.c file to fix wint_t
	  error  From Alan Carvalho de Assis (2018-06-09).
	* apps/examples/gps:  Add GPS example using MINMEA lib  From Alan
	  Carvalho de Assis (2018-06-09).
	* apps/Make.defs:  Fix an error introduced with recent chagne.
	  MKKCONFIG may not be defined resulting in failure to create
	  apps/Kconfig.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-06-11).
	* examples/powerled: add arch initialization; examples/smps: fixes in
	  some printf and in Kconfig
	  testing: add Unity - unit testing library from ThrowTheSwitch.org
	  From Mateusz Szafoni (2018-06-15).
	* apps/wireless/wapi:  Remove dependency on CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL from
	  Kconfig  From Gregory Nutt (2018-06-17).
	* Remove apps/interpreters/micropthon.  There are several reasons for
	  this.  (1) the current version 1.3.8 is very old and no one is
	  supporting it.  (2) the port only includes the core micropython logic
	  and none of the Python libraries.  As such it is useless in any real
	  application.  (3) There have recently been compile failures
	  reported.  It looks like this is due to changes in newlib based
	  toolchains that now bring in incompatible newlib header files.  See
	  issue 104 at
	  https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/issues/104/build-micropython-138-error.
	  With no one dedicated to the support of micropython, it can no longer
	  be carried in the NuttX apps/ repository.  From Gregory Nutt
	  (2018-06-18).
	* apps/nshlib/README.txt:  Clarify arguments to the mkrd command. From
	  Gregory Nutt (2018-06-22).
	* testing/unity: add configuration options for exclude setjmp and
	  output color  From Mateusz Szafoni (2018-06-23).
	* apps/netutils/dhcpc:  Activates BINDTODEVICE if available, and break
	  up some long lines  From Gregory Nutt (2018-06-25).
	* apps/examples/tcpblaster:  Add TCP performance measurement test.
	  From Gregory Nutt (2018-07-05).
	* apps/examples/dsptest:  Add unit test for Nuttx DSP library  From
	  Mateusz Szafoni (2018-07-07).
	* apps/examples/helloxx: Add main() for CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL  From
	  Masayuki Ishikawa (2018-07-13).
	* apps/examples/nsh:  Add logic to automatically register an
	  application symbol table as part of NSH initialization.  From
	  Masayuki Ishikawa (2018-07-13).
	* There many occurrences of the global variable g_exports and the
	  opportunity for collisions.  Make the global variable names unique.
	  From Gregory Nutt (2018-07-14).
	* apps/examples/nsh:  The symbol table name and size variable names can
	  now be configured.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-07-14).
	* import/:  Add Makefile.symtab which can be used to compile the
	  dynamically created symbol table C file.  Add tools/mksymtab.sh.
	  From Gregory Nutt (2018-07-15).
	* apps/tools: Add +x to mksymtab.sh.
	  apps/examples/nsh: Fix compile errors with
	  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NSH_SYMTAB=y  From Masayuki Ishikawa (2018-07-17).
	* apps Makesystem:  Fix an error when building apps/ without nuttx/,
	  using only the NuttX export package and assuming that the nuttx/
	  directory in not even present.  In this case, the problem fixed where
	  the apps/Make.defs file was selecting tools from the /tools directory
	  which does not exist because TOPDIR=apps/import.  Instead, for this
	  build case, I have not thought of any option but to duplicate scripts
	  as necessary in the apps/tools directory.  Also added a top-level
	  target to compile the symbol table.  Misc fixes: quoting in scripts,
	  some errors in script syntax.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-07-17).
	* apps/tools: Fix an error in mksymtab.sh  From Masayuki Ishikawa
	  (2018-07-19).
	* examples/lvgldemo/ and graphics/littlevgl/:  Update LVGL to version
	  5.1.1  From Alan Carvalho de Assis (2018-07-19).
	* fs/fat:  Clean up some name BS_ and MBR_ refer to the same record and
	  should use the same naming (MBR_).  From Gregory Nutt (2018-07-22).
	* Add definitions for the FAT boot record (FBR).  From Gregory Nutt
	  (2018-07-22).
	* nxplayer: Refactor nxplayer.c.  Apply netlib_parsehttpurl() and
	  remove unnecessary usleep().  From Masayuki Ishikawa (2018-07-31).
	* apps/system/i2c:  Adapt to rename I2C_M_RESTART->i2C_M_START.
	  I2C_M_NOSTOP should be in flags of first message in every write-read
	  and write-write mesage sequence.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-03).
	* include/netutils/netlib.h:  Eliminate a warning about AF_UNSPEC and
	  AF_INET not defined.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-03).
	* Introduce a build system for loadable apps for nsh.
	  apps/Make.defs:  Override COMPILE and COMPILEXX macros to compile
	  loadable apps.  To make loadable apps, -DLOADABLE_APP is added to the
	  flags.  Also, introduce ELFLD to link a lodable app.
	  apps/Application.mk:  Add .build target in case of 'LOADABLE=y' which
	  is used to link a final loadable application and install the app to
	  apps/bin.
	  apps/Makefile: Add SYMTABSRC and SYMTABOBJ variables for loadable
	  apps which will be generated under the apps directory.  Add
	  make_symbols target which will be called when all applications are
	  installed to generate symtab_app.c which is used for nsh to inform
	  symbol information to the NuttX kernel.  If the application is
	  specified to 'm', the variable 'LOADABLE' must be defined here. Also
	  note that other variables (PRIORITY and STACKSIZE) can only be used
	  for built-in apps.
	  apps/nshlib/Kconfig: Add 'option modules' to NSH_FILE_APPS so that a
	  user can change an application configuration to tristate (y/n/m)
	  apps/examples/hello and helloxx:  Apply changes to support a loadable
	  app.  Makefile: Change the condition to build. By default, the
	  application is not selected (i.e. 'n'), so if other states (i.e. y/m)
	  are selected, the application will be compiled.    Please note that
	  the variable 'LOADABLE' must be defined in each application Makefile
	  if you want to make a loadable app.  Change the application state
	  from bool to tristate in the Kconfig file.  Add LOADABLE_APP
	  condition to main().  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-03).
	* apps/examples/elf:  CROMFS and ROMFS configuration currently only
	  usable in FLAT build.  Add configuration to use ELF objects on
	  external media like SD card or USB drive instead.  From Gregory Nutt
	  (2018-08-04).
	* apps/examples/elf:  If the test ELF files are on media in removable
	  media such as SD or USB FLASH, the wait until the media has been
	  installed and initialized before starting the test.  From Gregory
	  Nutt (2018-08-04).
	* apps/examples/module:  Add support for CROMFS and for stripping
	  symbols from ELF module binaries.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-05).
	* examples/module:  Add support for automounting removable media.  This
	  involves a wait for the block driver to become available before
	  performing the mount.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-05).
	* apps/system/cle:  Usage improvements including command line history
	  (taken from readline) and support for addition control characters.
	  From mst (2018-08-05).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add parsing support for back-slash quoted characters.
	  Currently only implemented properly if CONFIG_NSH_ARGCAT is also
	  selected.  This commit is in response to Bitbucket Issue 11 opened by
	  Maciej Wójcik  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-06).
	* apps/examples/module:  When built in the PROTECTED or KERNEL modes,
	  the symbol table is not built by the application.  That is because
	  the build will fail since the kernel module depends on internal OS
	  symbols thar are not available to the application build.  With this
	  change the examples does not attempt to build the kernel symbol table
	  in these modes.  Instead it just copies the kernel module symbol
	  table into the nuttx/pass1 directory where it can be build directly
	  into the OS during pass2 of the build.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-07).
	* nsh: add inverted logic support in the form of 'if ! <cmd>'  From
	  Beat Küng (2018-08-11).
	* apps/nshlib:  I was able to cause an assertion with some typos in
	  testing the 'fi' command.  Not an important thing, but this will
	  protect against the assertion.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-11).
	* examples/calib_udelay:  Add tool for calibrating
	  CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC  From Juha Niskanen (2018-08-14).
	* apps/builtin/Makefile.  This commit changes apps/builtin to search
	  the registry recursively. By supporting directories, external
	  projects can install the hooks into the registry and easily clean
	  them up and reinstall if something needs to be updated.  Based on an
	  idea from Anthony Merlino.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-15).
	* apps/system/popen:  Add an implementation of the standard popen() and
	  pclose() OS interfaces.  These are implemented as applications vs.
	  part of the OS because they depend on NSH.  Untested on initial
	  commit.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-17).
	* apps/examples/popen:  Add a test of popen/pclose.
	  apps/system/popen:  Fix some errors found using the new popen/pclose
	  test.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-17).
	* apps/Application.mk:  If a loadable module is generated the we need
	  to add logic to remove the loadable module in the 'make clean'
	  logic.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-17).
	* apps/system/system and popen:  Adapt so that these can be used in the
	  KERNEL build mode.  In this case, simply replace task_spawn() with
	  posix_spawn().  This depends on the existence of some environment
	  where /bin/sh exists and can be used to execute one NSH command.  For
	  the case of system(), this change was more complete because it
	  previously used task_create().  Now it uses either task_spawn() or
	  posix_spawn(), depending upon the configuration.  From Gregory Nutt
	  (2018-08-18).
	* apps/system/nsh:  Move apps/examples/nsh to apps/system/nsh.  It has
	  become so entrenched that it is hardly an example these days.  May as
	  well formalized it as a system task.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-18).
	* i8sak: i8sak daemon now gets shutdown if not in use. Previously, once
	  the i8sak daemon was started, by running any command, it would stay
	  running. This means that if you want to use i8sak to setup your
	  network, but then want exclusive access to the char device, or
	  network device, you have to manually shutdown the i8sak daemon. Now
	  the daemon stays active as long as required to finish any commands,
	  or stays open if a new command keeps it on, but when all work is
	  finished, it shuts down.  From Anthony Merlino (2018-08-19).
	* Remove illegal calls into OS to initialize BINFMT support.  This must
	  be moved to the board initialization logic within the OS.  From
	  anchao (2018-08-22).
	* Move a copy of define.bat and sh from nuttx/tools to apps/tools so
	  that they will be available for the import build.  From Gregory Nutt
	  (2018-08-22).
	* apps/nshlib:  Expand reboot and poweroff commands to include a
	  second, optional mode argument  From ligd (2018-08-22).
	* apps/system/zmodem:
	  fix error "sz_main.o: No such file or directory"
	  support -p <path> for rz to change the folder for the received file
	  switch debug output from printf to syslog
	  send the next packet for ZME_ACK in ZMS_SENDING to avoid rz on the
	  host side stuck
	  make send work reliable even without hardware flow control  From
	  Xiang Xiao (2018-08-23).
	* apps/system/system/system.c:  Add 'const' to make function signature
	  compatible with OpenGroup.org  From Xiang Xiao (2018-08-23).
	* apps/system/ping and ping6:  Send ID and seqno in network byte
	  order.  From Xiang Xiao (2018-08-23).
	* apps/system/ping and ping6:  Change dependency in ping and ping6
	  Kconfig.  These may be implemented in users sockets and, hence, may
	  need to be avaiable even if ICMP and ICMPv6 sockets are not support.
	  From Xiang Xiao (2018-08-23).
	* apps/system/cu/cu_main.c: (1) Protect from possible re-definition of
	  signal values, (2) Fix CU ctrl-C hand when remote core hang.  From
	  ligd (2018-08-23).
	* apps/fsutils/mksmartfs:  Add a check to see if the SmartFS is already
	  formatted.  apps/nshlib:  Add a force flag (-f) to mksmartfs.  SmartFS
	  will be formatted only if (1) the FLASH does not already hold
	  a SmartFS, or (2) the force flag is set  From Xiang Xiao (2018-08-23).
	* apps/nshlib: (1) NSH prompt string is now configurable. nsh> is still
	  the default.  (2) Increase the default configuration for the maximum
	  number of command line arguments to 7 (CONFIG_NSH_MAXARGUMENTS).
	  This is needed for 'mount' with the -o option.  From Xiang Xiao
	  (2018-08-23).
	* apps/examples/module/Makefile:  Correct module example build.  Change
	  to LDLIBs were causing a failure due to a non-existent (any
	  unnecessary) library in this case.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-23).
	* apps/, most main() function: Correct CONFIG_BUILD_LOADABLE usage
	  Loadable apps/: Correct loadable symbol table generate
	  apps/system/ubloxmodem:  Fix build break
	  apps/examples/ostest: start restart/waitpid/user test from main loop
	  apps/nshlib:  Expand reboot and poweroff commands to include a
	  second, optional mode argument
	  An attempt to fix build issues.  Does not work.
	  apps/examples/ostest:  Fix some inappropriate renaming of static
	  functions introduced with recent patches.
	  apps/builtin/exec_builtin.c:  Fix a error introduced by recent
	  comments.  Found in build testing.
	  apps/builtin/exec_builtin.c:  Try posix_spawn if builtin apps do not
	  have have an entry point.
	  apps/Application.mk: introduce MODULE config to simplify tristate(m)
	  apps/nsh:  Change the nuttx shell module type to tristate
	  apps:  Add loadable application support
	  script/mksymtab:  Generate symbol table name by default
	  apps/builtin:  Allow loadable applications can register with
	  apps/builtin.  From anchao (2018-08-23).
	* Replace all ASSERT calls to DEBUGASSERT  From Xiang Xiao (2018-08-24).
	* apps/examples/sotest and modules:  With recent changes, LDLIBS is
	  initialized to bad value, at least in certain contexts.  From Gregory
	  Nutt (2018-08-24).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add control-C support for terminating built-in and
	  exec'ed file tasks.  From ligd (2018-08-26).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig:  Move 'option modules' from NSH_FILE_APPS to
	  BUILD_LOADABLE  From anchao (2018-08-27).
	* apps/system/nxplayer:  Release buffer before session and release
	  semaphore in nxplayer_setvolume
	  system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c:  Remove & for apb->samp reference. It is
	  already a pointer.  From Xiang Xiao (2018-08-27).
	* system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c:  Add playraw command  From ZhongAn
	  (2018-08-27).
	* apps/system/nxrecorder:  Add nxrecorder application  From ZhongAn
	  (2018-08-27).
	* nettest: fix typo: NET_LOOPBACK -> CONFIG_NET_LOOPBACK
	  nettest: fix compilation error. Should enable NET_SETSOCKOPT for
	  preventing compilation error.  From EunBong Song (2018-08-28).
	* apps/system/cu:  SIGKILL is more appropriate that SIGINT in this
	  circustance.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-28).
	* apps/: Call BOARDIOC_FINALINIT after start-up script (or immediately
	  after BOARIOC_INIT is there is no start-up script).  From ligd
	  (2018-08-28).
	* apps/system/cu:  Fix undefined SIGKILL if CONFIG_SIG_DEFUALT is not
	  defined.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-29).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_console.c: Do not dereference NULL 'pstate'  From
	  Juha Niskanen (2018-08-29).
	* apps/system/i2c: Allow registers besides 0x00 in the dev command.
	  From akob Haufe (2018-08-30).
	* system/i2c/i2c_main.c:  Fix a backward comparison.  Noted by Jakob
	  Haufe.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-30).
	* apps/ostest/suspend.c:  Add a small test for SIGSTOP, SIGCONT, and
	  SIGKILL actions.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-08-30).
	* examples/ostest/signest.c:  Attempt to make the nested signal test
	  compatible with the suspend/resume test.  Some signals cannot be
	  caught when the suspend/resume configuration is in place.  From
	  Gregory Nutt (2018-08-30).
	* apps/ examples/dhtxx: Example for the DHTxx sensor.  From Ouss4
	  (2018-09-01).
	* apps/nshlib:  When using waitpid() to wait for a built-in application
	  or a file application to exit.  Add the WUNTRACED options to so the
	  the waitpid() call will also be awakened if the waited-for task is
	  stopped as well.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-09-02).
	* apps/: Modification to build system: Unified application compilation
	  rules  From anchao (2018-09-03).
	* apps/:  Resolve some make dependency failures.  From anchao
	  (2018-09-03).
	* apps/platform/Makefile:  Fix missing dependency path in Makefile.
	  From Gregory Nutt (2018-09-03).
	* apps/:  Fix build break in case sama5d4-ek/elf configuration.  Also
	  fix a patch problem in mkromfsimg.h.  From anchao (2018-09-04).
	* Application.mk:  Even on Cygwin, GNU make insists that targets use
	  Unix style paths.  System/progmem:  Rename the install application to
	  progmem.  This generates a target install: which collides with the
	  install:: target in Application.mk.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-09-04).
	* Makefile:  platform/Makefile must have BIN_DIR defined on command
	  line even though it is not used.  This is because in the Cygwin
	  build, the value of 'BIN_DIR' is passed to 'cygpath'.  'cygpath will
	  fail if BIN_DIR is not defined.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-09-04).
	* Makefile:  Fix more places where attempts to use Unix-style paths
	  with native Windows toolchain.  tools/mksymtab.sh:  Add a check just
	  to prevent 'cat' of an empty file list from failing.  Right not the
	  root problem is that the are not executables being built or installed
	  in the exe/ directory.  That needs to be done by 'make import' but is
	  not happening.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-09-04).
	* Makefile:  In the make import target for kernel build, we must make
	  all objects and populate libapps.a.  Application.mk:  the PROGIST
	  must be executed unconditionally to support the kernel build.  From
	  Gregory Nutt (2018-09-04).
	* Application.mk:  Fix some issues when building directories such as
	  fsutils/mkfatfs that have no mainobj.  In this case, the MAINSRC is
	  undefined and it would generate a bad linker command line.  From
	  Gregory Nutt (2018-09-04).
	* Application.mk:  Add module install logic.  Possibly only needed in
	  KERNEL build mode? Makefile:  Simplify import target for KERNEL
	  build.  A symbol table is not needed because the KERNEL-mode programs
	  are completely linked.  Also fix missing deletion in clean and
	  distclean targets.  tools/mksymtab.sh:  Fix a typo introduced in
	  previous commit.  From Gregory Nutt (2018-09-04).
	* Makefile: 'make distclean' should remove the exe subdirectory  That
	  target must return the directory back to the state is was in when
	  freshly cloned.  Application.mk:  Add logic to strip unnecessary
	  symbols after installing a module.  But then I commented it out.
	  Wouldn't we want to keep the symbols if we planned to debug the
	  module?  In apps/examples/elf, there is configuration option to
	  determine if the symbols should be stripped or not.  Perhaps that is
	  needed here too?  From Gregory Nutt (2018-09-04).
	* Application.mk: Generate temporary name for linker object  From
	  anchao (2018-09-05).
	* netutils/ping: remove unsupported ping.  netutils/ping is not
	  supported anymore.  It's better to remove this folder for preventing
	  confusing.  ping is supported by system/ping.  From EunBong Song (2018-09-05).
	* Application.mk: Fix to not register a builtin app when BUILD_MODULE=y
	  apps/tools: Fix to generate CONFIG_SYSTEM_NSH_SYMTAB_COUNTNAME in
	  mksymtab.sh.  From Masayuki Ishikawa (2018-09-07)
