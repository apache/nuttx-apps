5.19 2011-03-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Initial version of the apps/ directory was released as contributed by
	  Uros Platise.

6.0 2011-03-21 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* README.txt -- README cosmetics
	* hello/ -- hello world minor changes
	* Makefile -- Makefile cosmetics (I am slowly adding the Darjeeling JVM)
	* Make.defs -- New file adds common make definitions for applications.
	* hello/Makefile -- Now uses new Make.defs definitions.  Added README.txt.
	* apps/poweroff -- New application to turn off board power.
	* Moved NSH library, netutils, and examples from the nuttx/ directory to
	  the apps/ directory
	* Moved exec_nuttapp machinery into the nuttapp/ directory.

6.1 2011-04-10 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Creation of auto-generated header files now occurs during the context
	  build phase.
	* Added sdcard insert and eject, nsh command '?' and some code remarks
	* Renamed nuttapp to namedapp
	* namedapp/binfs.c -- Create a tiny filesystem that can be used
	  to show the internal named apps under /bin.
	* Numerous fixes to build system required to support building with native
	  Windows toolchain.

6.2 2011-05-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nxffs:  Add a test a a configuration that will be used to
	  verify NXFFS.

6.3 2011-05-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/interpreter: Add a directory to hold interpreters.  The Pascal add-
	  on module now installs and builds under this directory.
	* apps/interpreter/ficl: Added logic to build Ficl (the "Forth Inspired
	  Command Language").  See http://ficl.sourceforge.net/.
	* apps/netutils/dhcpc, dhcpcd, and tftp.  If these directories are included
	  in the configuration but CONFIG_NET_UDP is disable (which is not very wise),
	  then a make error occurs because tools/mkdep.sh is called with no files.
	* system/free: Move Uros' custom free command from vsn/free
	* system/install: Add a new install command submitted by Uros Platise.
	* examples/rgmp.  Add a placeholder for an RGMP build example.
	  RGMP is a project for running GPOS and RTOS simultaneously on
	  multi-processor platforms. See http://rgmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
	  for further information about RGMP.  NOTE:  This is an empty example
	  on initial check-in.

6.4 2011-06-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c: If a network device name and IP address are provided
	  with the ifconfig command, then this command will now set the network address.
	  (Contributed by Yu Qiang).
	* netutils/ftpc: A library to support client-side FTP.
	* examples/ftpc: A simple add-on to the NSH.  From NSH, you can start
	  this simple FTP shell to transfer files to/from a remote FTP server.

6.5 2011-06-21 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* netutils/ftpc:  Simpflication and size reduction.

6.6 2011-07-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Make.defs, namedapp/namedapp.c: Several structural changes made to get a
	  clean compile under the ez80 ZDS-II toolchain (no design changes).
	* apps/examples/buttons: Add a test for the new standardized button interfaces
	* apps/examples/nxtext: Add another NX graphics test.  This one focus on
	  placing text on the background while pop-up windows occur.  Text should
	  continue to update normally with or without the popup windows present.

6.7 2011-08-02 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nx and nxtext:  These examples can now be built as NSH
	  "built-in" commands.
	* apps/examples/nxhello:  The simplest graphics example:  It just says
	  "Hello, World!" in the center of the display. This example can also be
	  built as an NSH "built-in" command.
	* apps/examples/nx, ntext, and nxhello:  All updated to use the new
	  NuttX font interfaces.
	* apps/examples/nximage:  Another super simple  graphics example:  It just puts
	  the NuttX logo in the center of the display. This example can also be
	  built as an NSH "built-in" command.
	* apps/examples/usbstorage: Can now be built as two NSH "built-in" commands:
	  'msconn' will connect the USB mass storage device; 'msdis' will disconnect
	  the USB storage device.
	* apps/examples/nx*:  All NX header files moved from nuttx/include/nuttx to
	  nuttx/include/nuttx/nx.
	* apps/examples/usbstorage: Added instrumentation to monitor memory usage
	  to check for memory leaks in the USB storage driver.
	* apps/examples/nxhello/nxhello_bkgd.c:  Fix handling of allocated glyph
	  memory.

6.8 2011-08-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nxlines:  Added a test for NX line drawing capabilities.

6.9 2011-09-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nxlines:  Extend the line drawing text to include drawing
	  of circles.
	* apps/system/i2c:  Add an I2C test tool that should help to bring up I2C
	  devices (when it is fully functional).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_timcmds.c:  Add the date command that can be used to
	  show or set the time (only if CONFIG_RTC is set).

6.10 2011-10-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/i2c:  Add repitition and address auto-incrementing so that
	  and command can be executed numerous times.  Add a new verify command
	  that will write to a register, read from register, and verify that
	  returned value.
	* apps/graphics/tiff:  Add a library that can be used to create TIFF files.
	* apps/examples/tiff:  Add a unit test for the TIFF file creation logic
	* apps/examples/lcdrw:  Add a test to verify if you can or can or read
	  data from an LCD correctly.
	* apps/examples/usbterm:  A USB terminal example.. more of a USB chat or
	  serial bridge:  Data received on local console echoed via USB serial;
	  data received on USB serial is echoed on the local console.
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  Add a simple, generic test for any
	  touschscreen driver.
	* Makefile:  The apps/ Makefile now checks for an apps/external directory
	  or symbolic link.  If such a directory/link exists (and has a Makefile),
	  it will be added to the apps/ build.  This allows external directories
	  to be included into the apps/ build by simply creating a symbolic link.

6.11 2011-11-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	(No major changes from 6.10)

6.12 2011-12-06 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/buttons:  The button test can now be executed as an NSH
	  built in command.

6.13 2012-12-26 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/dhcpd: May now be built as an NSH built-in application
	  by setting CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS.
	* apps/netutils/dhcpd/dhcpd.c: Fix several problems using host order address
	  where network addresses expected (and vice versa).
	* apps/examples/nettest: May now be built as an NSH built-in application
	  by setting CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS.
	* apps/examples/nettest: Correct some build issues with the nettest is
	  built for performance evaluation.
	* apps/examples/adc:  Add a very simple test to drive and test an ADC
	  driver.
	* apps/examples/pwm:  Add an NSH PWM command to drive and test a PWM
	  driver.
	* apps/examples/can:  Add an NSH CAN command to drive and test a CAN
	  driver in loopback mode.

6.14 2012-01-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/buttons/main.c:  The test needs to call up_buttoninit() to
	  properly configure the button interrupt GPIOs.
	* apps/examples/pwm:  Add support to test the pulse count option recently
	  added to the PWM interface.

6.15 2012-02-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/nsh_serial.c and nsh_usbdev.c:  If NuttX is configured to use
	  a USB serial console, then NSH needs to wait until the USB console is
	  connected and available.
	* apps/examples/composite:  Add a test of the USB composite device.
	* apps/examples/Telnetd:  Move the tiny uIP shell example from
	  netutils/Telnetd to examples/Telnetd.  Enhanced the Telnetd daemon so that
	  it supports Telnetd via a TTY device driver: A new TTY device driver is
	  created when each new Telnet connection is created.  The shell thread
	  is started with stdin, stdout, and stderr mapped to the TTY device.
	* netutils/Telnetd:  The old uIP Telnet demo is gone.  In its place is a new
	  Telnet infrastructure. The new Telnet daemon creates sessions that are
	  "wrapped" as character devices and mapped to stdin, stdout, and stderr.
	  Now the Telnet session can be inherited by spawned tasks.
	* examples/Telnetd:  Add a test for the new Telnet daemon.
	* examples/Telnetd/telnetd_driver.c: Move the internal socket structure from
	  the daemon's socket array into the driver's state data so that it will be
	  independent from the the Telnetd daemon.
	* apps/system/readline:  Moved the old nuttx/lib/stdio/lib_fgets.c here
	  and renamed it as readline().  The old fgets was simplied and the overloaded
	  readline functionality was removed.
	* apps/netutils/ftpd:  Add an FTPD server (does not even compile on initial
	  checkin).
	* apps/examples/ftpd:  Add a test for the FTPD server (untest on initial
	  check-in).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add support for a 'dmesg' command that will
	  dump the system log if CONFIG_SYSLOG is selected.

6.16 2012-03-10 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/qencoder:  Add a quadrature driver test.
	* apps/examples/ostest/fpu.c:  Add a test to verify that FPU registers
	  are properly saved and restored on context switches.
	* apps/system/readline/readline.c:  readline() will now treat either a
	  backspace or a DEL character as a backspace (i.e., deleting the character
	  to the left of the cursor).  This makes NSH less dependent on particular
	  keyboard mappings of the Backspace key.  Submitted by Mike Smith.
	* apps/system/cdcacm:  An example that illustrates how the CDC/ACM driver
	  may to connected and disconnected through software control.
	* apps/examples/nsh/nsh_main.c:  If available, call up_cxxinitialize() to
	  initialize all statically defined C++ classes.
	* apps/nshlib:  Now supports a USB serial device for NSH console I/O.  This
	  allows NSH to be used on boards that have USB but no serial connectors.

6.17 2012-04-14 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/can:  Add conditional compilation so that the test can be
	  configured to only send messages or to only receive messages.  This will
	  let the test work in other modes than simple loopback testing.
	* apps/examples/hello and apps/examples/ostest:  Can now be built as NSH
	  built-int functions.
	* vsn/hello:  Removed.  The modified apps/examples/hello is enough "Hello,
	  World!"
	* apps/examples/nxconsole:  Add a test of the NX console device.
	* apps/examples/nxconsole:  The NX console example now supports running
	  the NuttShell (NSH) within an NX window.
	* apps/system/readline:  Now uses standard definitions from
	  include/nuttx/ascii.h and vt100.h
	* Kconfig, */Kconfig:  Added skeleton Kconfig files to all directories that
	  may need them.

6.18 2012-05-19 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Kconfig:  Continued Kconfig file updates (no longer tracking on a per-file
	  basis in the ChangeLog)
	* apps/examples/watchdog:  Add a watchdog timer example.
	* apps/examples/tiff:  Fix wrong path used for temporary file.
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  Standardize the board-specific, touchscreen
	  initialization interfaces.

6.19 2012-06-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbdev.c:  Add the capability to use an arbitrary USB
	  device as the console (not necessarily /dev/console).  This is a useful
	  option because then you can still use the serial console to debug with.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbdev.c:  User now has to press ENTER 3 times before
	  USB console will start.  Otherwise, the USB console starts before there
	  is anyone at the other end to listen.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbdev.c and nsh_consolemain.c:  Add support for the USB
	  capability when a USB console is used.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add the 'mv' command

6.20 2012-07-12 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* namedapp/exec_namedapp.c - Correct an error when round robin scheduling
	  is enabled.  The priority of the new, named application was erroneously
	  being set to the priority of the parent thread; losing its configured
	  priority.  Reported by Mike Smith.

6.21 2012-08-25 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/include/: Stylistic clean-up of all header files.
	* apps/modbus and apps/include/modbus:  A port of freemodbus-v1.5.0
	  has been added to the NuttX apps/ source tree.
	* apps/examples/modbus:  A port of the freemodbus-v1.5.0 "demo"
	  program that will be used to verify the FreeModBus port
	* apps/modbus:  Don't use strerror().  It is just too big.
	* apps/modbus:  Add CONFIG_MB_TERMIOS.  If the driver doesn't support
	  termios ioctls, then don't bother trying to configure the baud, parity
	  etc.
	* apps/nshlib:  If waitpid() is supported, then NSH now catches the
	  return value from spawned applications (provided by Mike Smith)
	* apps/nshlib:  Lock the scheduler while starting built-in applications
	  in order to eliminate race conditions (also from Mike Smith).
	* apps/examples/adc, pwm, and qencoder:  Add support for testing
	  devices with multiple ADC, PWM, and QE devices.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c:  Separated mount-related commands out of
	  nsh_fscmds.c.  Extended to the mount command so that if no arguments
	  are provided, then the current mountpoints are enumerated.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c:  Add an NSH df command to list the
	  properties of mounted file systems.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Extend help command options.  'help' with
	  no arguments outputs a short list of commands.  With -v lists all
	  command line details.  A command name can be added to just get
	  help on one command.
	* system/readline.c:  If character input/output is interrupted by a
	  signal, then readline() will try the read/write again.
	* apps/*/Make.defs:  Numerous fixes needed to use the automated
	  configuration (from Richard Cochran).

6.22 2012-09-29 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/netutils/thttpd/thttpd_cgi.c:  Missing NULL in argv[]
	  list (contributed by Kate).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c: CONFIG_NSH_DISABLE_WGET not CONFIG_NSH_DISABLE_GET
	  in one location (found by Kate).
	* apps/examples/ostest/prioinherit.c:  Limit the number of test
	  threads to no more than 3 of each priority.  Bad things happen
	  when the existing logic tried to created several hundred test
	  treads!
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h:  Both CONFIG_LIBC_STRERROR and CONFIG_NSH_STRERROR
	  must be defined to use strerror() with NSH.
	* apps/examples/*/*_main.c, system/i2c/i2c_main.c, and others:  Added
	  configuration variable CONFIG_USER_ENTRYPOINT that may be used to change
	  the default entry from user_start to some other symbol.  Contributed by
	  Kate.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd/c:  Fix a typo that as introduced in
	  version r4402:  'lese' instead of 'else' (Noted by Max Holtzberg).
	* tools/mkfsdata.pl: The uIP web server CGI image making perl script was
	  moved from apps/netutils/webserver/makefsdata to nuttx/tools/mkfsdata.pl
	  (Part of a larger change submitted by Max Holtzberg).
	* apps/netutils/webserver, apps/examples/uip, and apps/include/netutils/httpd.h:
	  The "canned" version of the uIP web servers content that was at
	  netutils/webserver/httpd_fsdata.c has been replaced with a dynamically
	  built configuration located at apps/examples/uip (Contributed by
	  Max Holtzberg).
	* apps/netutils/webserver:  Several inenhancements from Kate including the
	  ability to elide scripting and SERVER headers and the ability to map
	  files into memory before transferring them.
	* apps/netutils/webserver:  Add ability to map a URL to CGI function.
	  Contributed by Kate.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c: The changes of 6.21 introduced holes in the
	  error handling:  Now the number of arguments to mount can be 0 or 4.
	  Additional parameter checking is required to prevent mysterious errors
	  (submiteed by Kate).
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd_mmap.c:  Fix errors when the mmap()
	  length is zero (submitted by Kate).
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd_sendfile.c:  Add and option,
	  CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_SENDFILE to transfer files using the NuttX
	  sendfile() interface.
	* apps/netutils/discover:  A UDP network discovery utility contributed
	  by Max Holtzberg.
	* apps/examples/discover:  A test example for the UDP network discovery
	  utility (also contribed by Max Holtzberg).
	* apps/examples/*/main.c:  Too many files called main.c.  Each renamed
	  to something unique so that they will not collide in the archive.
	* apps/netutils/xmlrpc: The Embeddable Lightweight XML-RPC Server
	  discussed at http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/\
	  an-embeddable-lightweight-xml-rpc-server/184405364.  Contributed by
	  Max Holtzberg.
	* apps/netutils/uip_listenon.c:  Logic in uip_server.c that creates
	  the listening socket was moved to this new file to support re-use.
	  Contributed by Kate.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  The option CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_SINGLECONNECT
	  can now be used to limit the server to a single thread.  Option
	  CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_TIMEOUT can be used to generate HTTP 408 errors.
	  Both from Kate.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  Improvements to HTTP parser from
	  Kate.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  Add support for Keep-alive connections
	  (from Kate).
	* apps/NxWidget/Kconfig:  This is a kludge.  I created this NxWidgets
	  directory that ONLY contains Kconfig.  NxWidgets does not live in
	  either the nuttx/ or the apps/ source trees.  This kludge makes it
	  possible to configure NxWidgets/NxWM without too much trouble (with
	  the tradeoff being a kind ugly structure and some maintenance issues).
	* apps/examples/Make.defs: Missing support for apps/examples/watchdog.
	* apps/NxWidgets/Kconfig:  Add option to turn on the memory monitor
	  feature of the NxWidgets/NxWM unit tests.

6.23 2012-11-05 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* vsn: Moved all NSH commands from vsn/ to system/.  Deleted the vsn/
	  directory.
	* Makefile:  Change order of includes when CONFIG_NEWCONFIG=y.  In
	  that case, namedapp must be included first so that the namedapp
	  context is established first.  If the namedapp context is established
	  later, it will overwrite any existing namedapp_list.h and nameapp_proto.h
	  files.
	* CONFIG_EXAMPLES_*: To make things consistent, changed all occurrences
	  of CONFIG_EXAMPLE_* to CONFIG_EXAMPLES_*.
	* Kconfig:  Fleshed out apps/examples/adc/Kconfig and apps/examples/wget/Kconfig.
	  There are still a LOT of empty, stub Kconfig files.
	* Kconfig:  Fleshed out apps/examples/buttons/Kconfig. There are still a LOT
	  of empty, stub Kconfig files.
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  Fix a bug that I introduced in
	  recent check-ins (Darcy Gong).
	* apps/netutils/webclient/webclient.c:  Fix another but that I introduced
	  when I was trying to add correct handling for loss of connection (Darcy Gong)
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_telnetd.c:  Add support for login to Telnet session via
	  username and password (Darcy Gong).
	* apps/netutils/resolv/resolv.c (and files using the DNS resolver): Various
	  DNS address resolution improvements from Darcy Gong.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c:  The ping command now passes a maximum round
	  trip time to uip_icmpping().  This allows pinging of hosts on complex
	  networks where the ICMP ECHO round trip time may exceed the ping interval.
	* apps/examples/nxtext/nxtext_main.c:  Fix bad conditional compilation
	  when CONFIG_NX_KBD is not defined.  Submitted by Petteri Aimonen.
	* apps/examples/nximage/nximage_main.c:  Add a 5 second delay after the
	  NX logo is presented so that there is time for the image to be verified.
	  Suggested by Petteri Aimonen.
	* apps/Makefile: Small change that reduces the number of shell invocations
	  by one (Mike Smith).
	* apps/examples/elf:  Test example for the ELF loader.
	* apps/examples/elf:  The ELF module test example appears fully functional.
	* apps/netutils/json:  Add a snapshot of the cJSON project.  Contributed by
	  Darcy Gong.
	* apps/examples/json:  Test example for cJSON from Darcy Gong
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netinit.c: Fix static IP DNS problem (Darcy Gong)
	* apps/netutils/resolv/resolv.c: DNS fixes from Darcy Gong.
	* COPYING: Licensing information added.
	* apps/netutils/codec and include/netutils/urldecode.h, base64.h, and md5.h:
	  A port of the BASE46, MD5 and URL CODEC library from Darcy Gong.
	* nsnlib/nsh_codeccmd.c:  NSH commands to use the CODEC library.
	  Contributed by Darcy Gong.
	* apps/examples/wgetjson: Test example contributed by Darcy Gong
	* apps/examples/cxxtest:  A test for the uClibc++ library provided by
	  Qiang Yu and the RGMP team.
	* apps/netutils/webclient, apps/netutils.codes, and apps/examples/wgetjson:
	  Add support for wget POST interface.  Contributed by Darcy Gong.
	* apps/examples/relays:  A relay example contributed by Darcy Gong.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds: Add ifup and ifdown commands (from Darcy
	  Gong).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds: Extend the ifconfig command so that it
	  supports setting IP addresses, network masks, name server addresses,
	  and hardware address (from Darcy Gong).

6.24 2012-12-20 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/ostest/roundrobin.c:  Replace large tables with
	  algorithmic prime number generation.  This allows the roundrobin
	  test to run on platforms with minimal SRAM (Freddie Chopin).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_dbgcmds.c:  Add hexdump command to dump the contents
	  of a file (or character device) to the console  Contributed by Petteri
	  Aimonen.
	* apps/examples/modbus:  Fixes from Freddie Chopin
	* apps/examples/modbus/Kconfig: Kconfig logic for FreeModBus contributed
	  by Freddie Chopin.
	* Makefile, */Makefile:  Various fixes for Windows native build.  Now uses
	  make foreach loops instead of shell loops.
	* apps/examples/elf/test/*/Makefile: OSX doesn't support install -D, use
	  mkdir -p then install without the -D.  From Mike Smith.
	* apps/examples/relays/Makefile: Reduced stack requirement (Darcy Gong).
	* apps/nshlib and apps/netutils/dhcpc:  Extend the NSH ifconfig command plus
	  various DHCPC improvements(Darcy Gong).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_apps.c: Fix compilation errors when CONFIG_NSH_DISABLEBG=y.
	  From Freddie Chopin.
	* Rename CONFIG_PCODE and CONFIG_FICL as CONFIG_INTERPRETERS_PCODE and
	  CONFIG_INTERPRETERS_FICL for consistency with other configuration naming.
	* apps/examples/keypadtest:  A keypad test example contributed by Denis
	  Carikli.
	* apps/examples/elf and nxflat:  If CONFIG_BINFMT_EXEPATH is defined, these
	  tests will now use a relative path to the program and expect the binfmt/
	  logic to find the absolute path to the program using the PATH variable.

6.25 2013-02-01 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Makefiles: Removed dependency of distclean on clean in most top-level
	  files.  It makes sense for 'leaf' Makefiles to have this dependency,
	  but it does not make sense for upper-level Makefiles.
	* apps/namedapp/: Renamed to builtins in preparation for another change.
	* .context:  Removed the .context kludge.  This caused lots of problems
	  when changing configurations because there is no easy way to get the
	  system to rebuild the context.  Now, the context will be rebuilt
	  whenever there is a change in either .config or the Makefile.
	* apps/builtin/registry:  Updated new built-in registration logic to handle
	  cases where (1) old apps/.config is used, and (2) applications ared
	  removed, not just added.
	* apps/examples/nettest/Makefile:  Fix an error that crept in during
	  some of the recent, massive build system changes.
	* apps/builtin/Makefile:  Need to have auto-generated header files
	  in place early in the dependency generation phase to avoid warnings.
	  It is not important if they are only stubbed out header files at
	  this build phase.
	* apps/examples/hidbkd: Now supports decoding of encoded special keys
	  if CONFIG_EXAMPLES_HIDKBD_ENCODED is defined.
	* apps/examples/hidbkd:  Add support for decoding key release events
	  as well.  However, the USB HID keyboard drier has not yet been
	  updated to detect key release events.  That is kind of tricky in
	  the USB HID keyboard report data.
	* apps/examples/wlan: Remove non-functional example.
	* apps/examples/ostest/vfork.c:  Added a test of vfork().
	* apps/exampes/posix_spawn: Added a test of posix_spawn().
	* apps/examples/ostest:  Extend signal handler test to catch
	  death-of-child signals (SIGCHLD).
	* apps/examples/ostest/waitpid.c:  Add a test for waitpid(), waitid(),
	  and wait().
	* builtin/binfs.c:  Add hooks for dup() method (not implemented).
	* builtin/exec_builtin.c, nshlib/nsh_parse.c, and nshlib/nsh_builtin.c:
	  NSH now supports re-direction of I/O to files (but still not from).
	* builtin/binfs.c:  Greatly simplified (it is going to need to be
	  very lightweight).  Now supports open, close, and a new ioctl to recover
	  the builtin filename.  The latter will be needed to support a binfs
	  binfmt.
	* builtin/binfs.c:  Move apps/builtin/binfs.c to fs/binfs/fs_binfs.c
	  CONFIG_APPS_BINDIR rename CONFIG_FS_BINFS
	* apps/include/builtin.h:  Some of the content of
	  apps/include/apps.h moved to include/nuttx/binfmt/builtin.h.
	  apps/include/apps.h renamed builtin.h
	* apps/builtin/exec_builtins.c:  Move builtin
	  utility functions from apps/builtin/exec_builtins.c to
	  binfmt/libbuiltin/libbuiltin_utils.c
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mountcmds.c:  The block driver/source
	  argument is now optional.  Many files systems do not need
	  a source and it is really stupid to have to enter a bogus
	  source parameter.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fileapp.c:  Add the ability to execute a file
	  from a file system using posix_spawn().
	* apps/builtin/: Extensions from Mike Smith.
	* apps/examples/ftpd/Makefile: Name ftpd_start is not the name of
	  the entrypoint.  Should be ftpd_main (from Yan T.)
	* apps/netutils/telnetd/telnetd_driver: Was stuck in a loop if
	  recv[from]() ever returned a value <= 0.
	* apps/examples/nettest and poll:  Complete Kconfig files.
	* apps/examples/ostest/waitpid.c:  Need to use WEXITSTATUS()
	  to decode the correct exit status.
	* apps/system/usbmonitor:  A daemon that can be used to monitor USB
	  trace outpout.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbdev.c, nsh_consolemain.c, nsh_session.c, nsh_script.c:
	  Add support for a login script.  The init.d/rcS script will be executed
	  once when NSH starts; the .nshrc script will be executed for each session:
	  Once for serial, once for each USB connection, once for each Telnet
	  session.
	* apps/system/readline: Correct readline() return value.  Was not
	  any returning special values when end-of-file or read errors
	  occur (it would return an empty string which is not very useful).

6.26 2013-03-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/builtin/exec_builtin.c:  Now uses task_spawn() to start
	  builtin applications.
	* Type of argv has changed from const char ** to char * const *
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Fix memory lead: Need to detach after
	  creating a pthread.
	* apps/examples and nshlib:  Change name of _TCB to struct tcb_s to
	  match NuttX name change.
	* apps/examples/ostest/restart.c:  Add a test case to verify
	  task_restart().
	* apps/system/readline.c:  readline() now returns EOF on any failure
	  (instead of a negated errno value).  This is because the underlying
	  read is based on logic similar to getc.  The value zero was being
	  confused with a NUL.  So if a NUL was received, the NSH session
	  would terminate because it thought it was the end of file.

6.27 2013-04-28 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/ramtest:  Add a simple memory test (2013-03-26).
	* apps/examples/ostest:  In the non-cancelable thread test, we need
	  to give the thread an opportunity to run and to set the non-
	  cancelable state.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_ddcmd.c: Correct the test of the skip input
	  parameter.  Was limiting the range to <= count.  From Ken
	  Petit (2014-4-24).

6.28 2013-06-14 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/mtdpart:  Provides a simple test of MTD partitions.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c:  Add a -h option to the df command to show
	  the volume information in human readable form (Ken Petit, 2013-4-30).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c: Add support for the mksmartfs command.
	  (Ken Petit, 2013-4-30).
	* apps/system/flash_eraseall:  Add an interface to erase FLASH using a
	  flash_eraseall NSH command  (Ken Pettit, 2013-5-1).
	* apps/examples/flash_test and apps/examples/smart_test:  Add tests of
	  the SMART block driver and file system  (Ken Pettit, 2013-5-1).
	* apps/examples/mtdpart:  Extended the test.  The original test
	  coverage was superficial (2013-5-3).
	* apps/examples/smart:  This is an adaptation of the NXFFS stress
	  test for the SMART file system (Ken Pettit, 2013-5-3).
	* apps/examplex/nxtext:  Remove the CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NXTEXT_NOGETRUN
	  option.  The test logic was bad for the case where this options
	  is not selected.  Also, complete the empty Kconfig file (2013-5-7).
	* apps/NxWidgets/Kconfig:  Updated to match NxWidgets/Kconfig by
	  Ken Pettit (2013-5-11).
	* apps/examples/helloxx:  C++ name mangling was occurring when this
	  example is built as an NSH built-in application.  (2013-5-16).
	* apps/netutils/discover:  Added a runtime configuration for the
	  UDP discover utility.  From Max Holtzberg (2013-5-21).
	* apps/examples/tcpecho:  Added a simple single threaded, poll based
 	  TCP echo server based on W. Richard Stevens UNIX Network Programming
	  Book.  Contributed by Max Holtzberg (2013-5-22).
	* apps/examples/slcd:  Add an example for testing alphanumeric,
	  segment LCDs (2013-5-24).
	* apps/examples/slcd:  Extend SLCD test to handle multi-line displays
	  (2013-5-26).
	* apps/examples/slcd:  This test now sets the SLCD brightness level to
	  the mid-point as part of its initialization (2013-5-27).
	* .gitignore:  Clean-up of most all .gitignore files:  Make scope of
	  ignore to be only the current directory; Ignore .dSYM files in
	  directories where .exe's may be build.  Also, in Makefiles,
	  clean .dSYM files in directories where .exe may be built (2013-5-30).
	* apps/examples/nrf35l01_term: Add an example application to demo the
	  nRF24L01 driver.  From Laurent Latil (2013-6-1).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig:  Add some missing NSH configuration values.
	  From Lorenz Meier (2013-6-2).
	* Standardize on CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS.  Remove all other variants
	  of the build-as-an-NSH-application configuration settings
	  (2013-6-12).

6.29 2013-07-31 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/nsh, cxxtest, and helloxx:  C++ initializers should be
	  set once and, preferably, in the context of the task that uses any C++
	  statically initialized classes.  These only becomes an issue if cxxtest
	  or helloxx are built as NSH builtin applications.  Then you want the
	  initialization done in cxxtext or helloxx and not in NSH (and certainly
	  not twice).  Added configuration options to control who does the C++
	  initialization.  NSH now does not do C++ initialization be default and
	  must be configured to do otherwise.  Converely, cxxtest and helloxx
	  will do C++ initialization unless configured do otherwise (2013-6-21).
	* apps/examples/cxxtext:  Add ostream test as provided by Michael
	  (2013-6-21).
	* apps/examples/nxhello:  Minor fix for compilation error when the
	  display resolution is low (< 8bpp) due to a typo that has been there
	  for a long time (2013-6-23).
	* apps/examplex/nxhello:  Correct default colors when in Y1 code mode.
	  (2013-6-24).
	* apps/system/Make.defs and Kconfig:  The RAM test was not correctly built
	  into the configuration and build system (2013-6-26).
	* apps/examples/composite/composite_main.c:  SourceForge But Ticket #19.
	  Change to prevent some false alarm debug assertions (From Chia Cheng
	  Tao, 2013-7-9).
	* apps/system/zmodem:  Add configuration support and a build framework
	  for the Zmodem sz and rz command (which exist but have not yet been
	  checked in) (2013-7-12).
	* apps/system/zmodem:  The 'sz' command is now complete and seems
	  functional (given on light testing).  The rz command logic exists but
	  is still untested and not yet checked in  (2013-7-13).
	* apps/system/zmodem:  The 'rz' command is now complete and functional
	  under certain conditaions.  There are, however, some data overrun
	  issues that I am still uncertain how should be handled (2012-7-15).
	* apps/system/zmodem/Makefile.host and host/: The Zmodem utilities
	  can now be built to execute on a Linux host.
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add a 'cmp' command that can be used to
	  compare two files for equivalence.  Returns an indication if the files
	  differ.  Contributed by Andrew Tridgell (via Lorenz Meier) (2013-7-18).

6.30 2013-09-14 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/composite/:  SourceForge bug #19: Fix a typo that can
	  cause a configuration error.  From CCTSAO (2013-9-4).
	* apps/examples/cc3000.  Initial support for the TI CC3000 network module
	  on the Freescale Freedom-KL25Z board from Alan Carvalho de Assis.
	  Includes the test to verify the CC3000 (2013-9-3).
	* apps/examples/usbmsc:  apps/examples/usbstorage renamed usbmsc.
	  Change submitted by CCTSAO (2013-6-5).
	* apps/examples/pwm:  Clean-up some configuration confusion (2013-9-5).
	* apps/netutils/dhcpd/dhcpd.c:  Fix calculation of the next lease
	  address.  SourceForge bug #21 from Paolo Messina (2013-9-6).
	* apps/examples/usbmsc:  Don't try to control USB trace if we are
	  an NSH built-in task.  In that case our attempts are inadequate
	  and only interfere with with other logic that is attempting to
	  to do the same thing (in NSH or in the USB monitor) (2013-9-6).
	* apps/examples/usbmsc:  IMPORTANT bug fix: Change how the msconn
	  works.  Because of recent changes the msconn command was hanging.
	  This was because the USB MSC start-up logic creates a pthread;
	  Now waitpid() will wait until all members of the task group
	  exit.  So NSH was hanging in waitpid when msconn started even
	  though msconn returned.  The USB MSC logic really should not use
	  a pthread, but we are stuck with that for now.  The work-around
	  is that msconn now daemonizes itself so that it so that the pthread
	  is created in a different task group (2013-9-7).
	* apps/system/usbmonitor:  The USB monitor has been extended so
	  that it can be used with USB device or host trace data (2013-9-9).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Fix NSH listing output for the case
	  of a single file.  Provided by Lorenz Meier (2013-9-13).

6.31 2013-10-28 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c:  Remove a warning when DHCP is not
	  enabled (2013-9-17).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig:  Default IP address should be 0x0a000001
	  (10.0.0.1), not 0xa0000001 (160.0.0.1).  Ditto for the gateway
	  (2013-9017).
	* apps/examples/ostest/Kconfig:  Add configuration options for
	  the FPU test.  There are still many OS test configuration
	  options that do not appear in Kconfig (2013-9-18).
	* apps/examples/cc3000:  Condition the CC3000 example on having
	  selected the CC3000 device.  Otherwise, you are prompted for
	  this option on each 'make oldconfig' (2013-9-18).
	* apps/system/usbmonitor/usbmonitor.c:  Fix some bad conditional
	  compilation probably introduced on 2013-9-9 (2013-9-23).
	* apps/system/stackmonitor:  Add a daemon that can be used to
	  monitor stack usage by all threads (2013-9-24).
	* system/usbmsc:  Move examples/usbmsc to system/usbmsc (2013-9-25).
	* system/cdcacm:  Move examples/cdcacm to system/cdcacm (2013-9-25).
	* system/composite:  Move examples/composite to system/composite
	  (2013-9-25).
	* apps/nshlib and apps/readline:  Numerous changes to get NSH
	  working with no file system.  Basically this suppresses I/O
	  redirection and replaces file I/O with calls to low-level
	  console read/write functions.  Suggested by Alan Carvalho de Assis
	  in a somewhat different form. (2013-9-30).
	* apps/nshlib/nsm_routecmds.c:  Add addroute and delroute
	  commands (2013-10-5).
	* apps/system/i2ctool/Kconfig:  Fix default I2C frequency:  400KHz
	  instead of 4MHz.  Suggested by Max Kriegleder (2013-10-10).
	* apps/system/info/Kconfig and Makefile:  Increase stack size.
	  Ken Petit reports that this simple command can exceed its 768
	  stack size under certain conditions.  The size is marginal and
	  has been increased to 1024 by default but is also now configurable
	  (2013-10-14).
	* apps/Makefile:  Need to include external/Make.defs if we want
	  allow external applications to participate in the NuttX
	  configuration.  Suggested by gdi@embedders.org (2013-10-14).
	* apps/examples/cc3300: Updates as part of larger re-organizaion
	  of CC3000 logic by David Sidrane (2013-10-16).
	* apps/examples/random:  Add a simple test that dumps values from
	  /dev/random (2013-10-20).
	* apps/examples/cc3000:  Extensions and enhancements from David
	  Sidrane (2013-10-23).
	* apps/netutils/telnetd/telnetd_driver.c:  Missing argument to
	  debug statement can cause crashes in certain error conditions.
	  From David Sidrane (2013-10-24).
	* apps/examples/cc3000:  Updates from David Sidrane.  Plus
	  some kruft removal (2013-10-24).
	* apps/examples/can/can_main.c:  Correct an error in a debug
	  statement.  From Martin Lederhilger (2013-10-24).
	* apps/examples/adc:  Add support so that a ADC driven by
	  software triggering can be tested (2013-10-25).
	* apps/examples/cc3000:  Updates from David Sidrane (2013-10-25).
	* apps/system/nxplayer:  Implements a command line media
	  player.  From Ken Pettit (2013-10-27).
	* apps/system/nxplayer: Add logic to verify the audio sub-format.
	  From Ken Pettit (2013-10-28).

6.32 2013-12-07 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/platform:  A new home for board-specific application code
	  (2013-10-30).
	* apps/include/platform/configdata.h:  Define an interface that can be
	  used to manage platform-specific storage of configuration data
	  (2013-10-30).
	* apps/examples/cc3000: Fine tuning of memory usage from David Sidrane
	  (2013-10-30).
	* apps/platform/mikroe-stm32f4: Now supports storage of configuration
	  data.  From Ken Pettit (2013-10-30).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_dbgcmds.c and others:  Add skip= and count=
	  options to the hexdump command.  From Ken Pettit (2013-11-1).
	* apps/platform/mikroe-stm32f4:  Now uses /dev/config for configuration
	  data storage.  From Ken Pettit (2013-11-1).
	* apps/platform/Makefile:  Was not dealing with the bin sub-directory
	  correctly (2013-11-2).
	* apps/examples/configdata:  A unit test for the MTD configuration
	  data driver from Ken Pettit (2013-11-4).
	* apps/platform/mikroe-stm32f4:  Updated to use new MTD configuration
	  driver features.  From Ken Pettit (2013-11-1).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h:  Allow USB trace without a USB console. From
	  David Sidrane (2013-11-06).
	* apps/system/composite/composite_main.c:  The wrong handle was getting
	  nullified.  From David Sidrane (2013-11-7).
	* apps/system/nxplayer: Play thread stack size is now configurable.  All
	  NxPlayer threads now have names assigned via pthread_setname_np().
	  From Ken Pettit (2013-11-10).
	* apps/examples/i2schar:  The beginning of an I2S test based on the I2S
	  character driver (2013-11-10).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c:  Mount command updates from Ken Pettit
	  (2013-11-17).
	* apps/examples/hidkbd/hidkbd_main.c:  Now calls a function named
	  arch_usbhost_initialize() that must be provided by the platform-
	  specific code (2013-11-29).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add an option to the mkfatfs command to
	  specify FAT12, FAT16, or FAT32 (2013-12-5).

6.33 2014-01-30 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/nsh_mntcmds.c:  Modified the df -h logic to eliminate
	  truncating numbers in conversion (like 7900 -> 7M).  From Ken
	  Pettit (2013-12-12).
	* Moved configs/stm3240g-eval/src/up_cxxinitialize.c to
	  apps/platform/stm3240g-eval/up_cxxinitialize.c:  Now it is available
	  in user-space in the kernel mode build (2013-12-29).
	* apps/examples/mount/Kconfig:  Fill in empty Kconfig file (2013-12-31).
	* builtin/Makefile: Fixes for native Windows build from Max Holtzberg
	  (2014-1-4).
	* apps/netutils/dhcpc/Kconfig, resolv/Kconfig, telnetd/Kconfig, and
	  apps/nshlib/Kconfig:  Refactor some configuration dependencies:  NSH
	  features should depend on netutil selections; netutil selections
	  should depend on networking selections. (2014-1-9).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_command.c:  Separate NSH command handling from NSH
	  line parsing.  This re-partitioning simplifies the logic and will
	  enable some things to come (2014-1-10).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Will now support multiple commands on a
	  command line, each separated with a semi-colon (2014-1-10).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Put the logic that executes a command
	  after parsing parameters into a separate file so that it can be
	  reused (2014-1-10).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Add initial support of commands enclosed
	  in back quotes as command arguments.  Functionality still incomplete
	  on initial commit (2014-1-10).
	* Logic to support commands enclosed in back quotes is functional
	  but not thoroughly tested (2014-1-11).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Can now handle arguments that are
	  concatenations of constant strings, command return data, application
	  return data, and environment variables (2014-1-11).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Fix a memory leak ... forgot to close
	  a temporary file (2013-1-12).
	* apps/system/inifile:  A simple INI file parser (perhaps too simple).
	  This is code that I wrote a long time ago and have used many time but
	  is untested in its current incarnation (2014-1-15).
	* aps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Recent changes broke redirection of output
	  (2014-1-14).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Add true and false commands (2014-1-17)
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h and nsh_parse.c:  Re-name and re-organize some
	  if-then-else related structures to better support forthcoming until
	  and while loops (2014-1-17).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_script.c:  Now saves the FILE stream for the script
	  file in the vtbl structure so that it can be accessed by forthcoming
	  while and until logic (2014-1-17).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h, nsh_command.c, nsh_parse.c, and nsh_script.c:  Add
	  support for while-do-done and until-do-done loops.  These only work
	  when executing a script file because they depend on the ability to seek
	  in the file to implement the looping behaviors (2014-1-17).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c:  Loosen up if-then-else-fi syntax to allow
	  a command to be on the same line as the then and else tokens like:
	  "if true; then echo true; else echo false; fi".  Much more like bash!
	  (2014-1-17).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig, README.txt, nsh.h, nsh_command.c, and
	  nsh_script.c:  Add an option to conditionally compile out support for
	  loop and for if-then-else-fi sequence (2014-1-17).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h, nsh_command.c, and nsh_parse.c:  Add a break
	  command that can be executed with a loop to terminate the loop
	  immediately (2014-1-17).
	* apps/system/vi:  Add support for a tiny, VI work-alike editor.  This
	  is still very much a work-in-progress on initial check-in (2014-1-20).
	* apps/netutils/uiplib:  Support new definitions and state passing for
	  network device status. From Maz Holtzberg (2014-1-21).
	* apps/system/vi:  Tiny VI is basically functional.  All commands seem
	  to work.  There are still some display artifacts and probably several
	  untested conditions (2014-1-21).

7.1 2014-03-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/cle:  Add a EMACS-like command line editor.  This CLE,
	  is really more like readline than the NuttX readline is!  (2014-02-02).
	* apps/nshlib: Use of the standard tiny readline (about .25KB) is now
	  an option and can be replaces with the EMACX-like CLE (about 2KB)
	  (2014-02-02).
	* Several changes to restore Windows native build (2014-2-7)
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  Can now be configured to work with a mouse
	  interface as well (2014-2-10).
	* Several files changes based on complaints from the tool CppCheck.  Some
	  latent bugs were fixed (and most likely some new typos were introduced)
	  (2014-2-10).
	* apps/examples/nximage/Kconfig and apps/examples/uip/Kconfig: Incomplete
	  Kconfig files fleshed out by Alan Carvalho de Assis (2014-2-18).
	* apps/nshlib: 'rmdir' can now be used in the pseudo-filesystem.  Hence,
	  the command needs to be available even if there are no write-able
	  filesystem enabled (2014-2-19).
	* apps/nshlib: 'mkdir' can now be used in the pseudo-filesystem.  Hence,
	  the command needs to be available even if there are no write-able
	  filesystem enabled (2014-2-19).
	* apps/nshlib: 'mv' can now be used in the pseudo-filesystem.  Hence,
	  the 'mv' command needs to be available even if there are no write-able
	  filesystem enabled (2014-2-19).
	* apps/nshlib: 'rm' can now be used to remove nodes from the pseudo-
	  filesystem.  Hence, the 'rm' command needs to be available even if there
	  are no write-able filesystem enabled (2014-2-20).
	* CONFIG_DISABLE_PSEUDOFS_OPERATIONS: This new configuration setting
	  basically backs out the recent changes to mv, rm, mkdir, and rmdir
	  (2014-2-20).
	* nshlib/Kconfig:  Use CONFIG_DEFAULT_SMALL in selecting default
	  settings (2014-2-20).
	* nshlib/nsh_telnetd.c:  Use strncpy vs strcpy to avoid overruning the
	  username and password buffers.  From Bertold Van den Bergh (2014-2-22).
	* nshlib/Kconfig, nsh_proccmds.c:  If the CPU load feature and the procfs
	  features are enabled, then show CPU load used by each thread in the
	  'ps' command (2014-2-27).
	* nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Add a newline after printing the file in the
	  'cat' command.  This prevents the NSH prompt from be in the same line
	  as the final line of the file in the case where there is no newline
	  at the end of the file (2014-2-27).
	* netutils/dhcpd/dhcpd.c: allocipaddr() should not call ntohl(), the
	  returned IP address is already in host order.
	* apps/netutils/dhcpd/Kconfig: Add missing DHCPD configuration
	  settings(2014-3-3).
	* Support for the legacy configuration mechanism (using appconfig files)
	  is removed.  Only the newer configuration using the kconfig-frontends
	  tools is now supported (2014-3-6).

7.2 2014-04-29 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c: Fix NuttShell version number display in
	  welcome message.  version.h was not being included (2014-3-23).
	* apps/examples/igmp:  Fill out Kconfig file; update makefile so
	  that the IGMP example can be used as an NSH built-in application.
	  From Manuel Stühn (2014-3-24).
	* apps/system/usbmsc:  Back out the USBMSC daemon... it is no longer
	  needed with the recent fix to the USBMSC class driver (2014-3-25).
	* apps/examples/lcdrw:  Fill out empty Kconfig file (2014-2-27).
	* apps/netutils/dhcpd/dhcpd.c:  The correct value of the PAD option
	  is zero, not one.  From Brennan Ashton (2014-3-31).
	* apps/sysinfo:   CONFIG_VERSION_BUILD is a string an needs to be
	  printed with %s, not %d.  Noted by Librae (2014-4-8).
	* apps/netutils/ntpclient/ and apps/include/netufils/ntpclient.h:  Add
	  a very primitive NTP client.  The initial check-in is untested and
	  probably incomplete (2014-4-10).
	* apps/netutils/resolv:  Long needed major clean up for coding style
	  and unification of naming conventions (resolv vs dns) (2014-4-11).
	* apps/netutils/dnsclient and include/netutils/dnsclient.h:  File name
	  changes that are part of the overal resolv->dns renaming (2014-4-11).
	* apps/netutils/dnsclient:  Break the one big monolithic file into
	  three smaller files (2014-4-11).
	* apps/netutils/ntpclient/ntpclient.c: Corrections to the NTP client
	  from Manuel Stuehn (2014-4-12).
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  Add a configuration option to indicate if
	  architecture-specific initialized is required, yes or no (2014-4-14).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c:  Compilation failure in one
	  configuration reported by Manuel Stuhn (2014-4-21).
	* apps/system/sdcard:  Remove an STM32 dependency.  From Bob Doiron
	  (2014-4-21).
	* apps/nshlib: malloc/free IOBUFFER for 'cat' and 'hexdump' commands
	  instead of using the stack.  From Bob Doiron (2014-4-21).
	* apps/examples/cpuhog, serialblaster, and serialrx:  Stress test
	  examples added by Bob Doiron (2014-4-22).
	* apps/examples/telnetd:  Naming is confused.  In someplaces 'telnetd',
	  and in others 'shell.'  All changes to telnetd.  Noted by Pelle
	  Windestam (2014-4-38).

7.3 2014-06-25 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/serialblaster:  Update configuration an make logic in
	  order to select that the serial blaster task priority and stack size.
	  From Bob Doiron (2014-4-30).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig and other NSH files:  The alternate console device
	  CONFIG_NSH_CONDEV must not be defined unconditionally.  This causes errors
	  when using Telnet sessions.  This was solved by adding CONFIG_NSH_ALTCONDEV:
	  CONFIG_NSH_ALTCONDEV enables or disables the feature then, if enabled,
	  CONFIG_NSH_CONDEV provides the alternative console device name (2014-5-5).
	* apps/system/i2c/i2c_get.c:  Fix to show the updated register address on
	  each fetch (vs. showing the same starting address each time).  From
	  Ryan VanSickle (2014-5-8).
	* apps/interpreters/prun and apps/include/interpreters/prun.h:  Broke out
	  the P-code execution logic from apps/examples/pashello and moved it to
	  these directory where it can be used more generally (2014-5-9).
	* apps/system/prun and apps/include/interpreters/pexec_main.c:  Move the
	  P-Code execution logic from apps/interpreters/prun to
	  apps/system/prun; Add pexec_main.c which is an NSH built-in
	  application that can be used to run P-Code programs from the NSH
	  command line (2014-5-9).
	* Several files: Convert all old-style variadic macros to the C99 form.
	  Recent GCC changes tightens up that behavior and can cause some problems
	  (at least for the IAR compiler for some reason).  See
	  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Variadic-Macros.html#Variadic-Macros.
	  Noted by Bob Grimes (2014-5-22).
	* apps/system/cle:  CLE was not returning the terminating newline character.
	  But reported by Max kriegleder; work-around reported by Lorenz Meier
	  (2015-5-23).
	* Misc changes due to moving nuttx/net/uip/uip-arp.h to nuttx/net/arp.h
	  (2015-5-30).
	* apps/examples/netpkt/:  A "raw" socket test from Lazlo Sitzer
	  (2014-6-12).
	* apps/system/hex2bin/:  A library and built-in task to convert from
	  Intel HEX to binary format.  Untested on initial commit (2014-6-15).
	* apps/system/hex2bin/: Appears to be functional but testing is still
	  light (2014-6-16).
	* apps/system/hex2bin/hex2mem_main: Add a variant application that will
	  write Intel HEX files directly to memory (2014-6-16).
	* netutils/webserver: httpd_fs_open() should return OK on success and
	  ERROR on failure, not 1 and 0 (2014-6-23)

7.4 2014-08-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/mdio:  PHY tool from Daniel Lazlo Sizter (2014-6-27).
	* apps/nshlib:  Networking logic modified to handler the case of SLIP
	  transport.  From Max Neklyudov (2014-6-27).
	* apps/nshlib:  if # appears on line, need to comment ignore additional
	  commands on the line (2014-7-1).
	* apps/netlib: Renamed all occurrences of uiplib to netlib.  Renamed
	  files under netutils/uiplib/uip_*.c to netutils/netlib/netlib_*.c.
	  Renamed all functions defined in netutils/netlib/ to begin with netlib_,
	  instead of uip_. (2014-7-2).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbkeyboard.c:  Add a configuration to use a USB
	  keyboard for the stdin device (2014-7-3).
	* apps/neturils/webclient/webclient.c:  Fix to offset calculation from
	  Rony Xln.  Prevents 0x0a at the beginning of lines (2014-7-7).
	* netutils/webserver (and other files):  Fix some configuration usage:
	  CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_SENDFILE was missing from Kconfig; CONFIG_NET_HAVE_SOLINGER
	  should be CONFIG_NET_SOLINGER; Type of CONFIG_NET_HTTPD_MAXPATH was wrong
	  in Kconfig file.  From Max (2014-7-11).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c:  Check for file read errors and end-of-file
	  with zero bytes read (2014-7-23).
	* apps/system/nxplayer: Misc changes to better integrate with
	  NxWM::CMediaPlayer (2014-7-23).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c and apps/include/nxplayer.h: Add hooks
	  for fast-forward and rewind needed by CMediaPlayer; add hooks for
	  equalizer settings needed by the WM8904  (2014-7-24).
	* apps/include/nxplayer.h and apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c: Changes to
	  integrate with Ken's NxWM::CMediaPlayer (2014-7-24).
	* apps/include/nxplayer.h: Move subsampling rate definitions from nxplayer.h
	  to audio.h *2014-7-27).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c: NxPlayer needs to set curbyte field to
	  zero before enqueuing a buffer.  Otherwise, it looks like beginning of
	  the buffer has already been consumed. (2014-7-27).
	* apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  Missing logic to close sockets on loop
	  termination.  From Max (2014-7-28).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c:  Fix some error handling, update
	  comments, more debug output (2014-7-31).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c: Change how the end of the audio
	  stream is detected by the leaf audio component.  This used by be done
	  by looking for the first partial buffer.  That does not work with the
	  in-place sub-sampling performed by the PCM decoder:  That always reduces
	  the size of the buffer so that all buffers only partially filled by the
	  time they get to the leaf.  Now, a flag is set in the audio buffer
	  flags set to indicate the final buffer in the stream (2014-7-31).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c: Fix an error I introduced:  Need to
	  pass through final buffer even if is it zero length because it contains
	  the end of audio stream flag (2014-8-1).
	* apps/system/nxplayer/nxplayer.c: Break reading and enqueueing of audio
	  buffers into two steps so that errors in enqueueing can be
	  distinguished from errors in reading.  Errors in enqueueing signal a
	  downstream decoder error.  Add logic to gracefully recover from
	  downstream decoder errors (2014-8-5).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig, nsh.h, and nsh_netinit.c: Software assigned MAC
	  address is now configurable. From Lazlo (2014-8-6).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig, nsh.h, and nsh_netinit.c: Also add an option to
	  let platform-specific logic select the MAC address (2014-8-5).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig, nsh.h, and nsh_netinit.c:  There is now a
	  configuration option that will bring up the network on an separate
	  thread.  Since the network bring-up is asynchronous, there are not
	  serial console start-up delays due to the network negotiation time
	  (2014-8-6).
	* apps/system/sudoku:  Add a sudoku game (2014-8-11).

7.5 2014-09-28 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig, nsh.h, and nsh_netinit.c:  Extend the NSH network
	  initialization logic.  There is now an option that will create a
	  network monitor thread that will monitor the state of the link.  When
	  the link goes down, the code will attempt to gracefully put the
	  Ethernet driver in a down state; When the link comes back, the code
	  will attempt to bring the network back up (2014-8-17).
	* apps/system/free/free.c and install/install.c: STM32 FLASH fixes:
	  use size_t instead of uint16_t, make interface more generic.  From
	  Freddie Chopin (2014-8-28).
	* apps/examples/elf:  The ELF test/example has been extended so the
	  individual ELF test programs can link against the SYSCALL library
	  (if it is available) or against the C library to eliminate or
	  minimize the need for symbol tables (2014-8-29).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_proccmds.c: Fix NSH PS command:  If there are no
	  arguments, it would print garbage for argument list (2014-9-1).
	* apps/import/, apps/tools/, apps/Makefile: Beginning of logic that
	  will, hopefully, allow me to build applications against a NuttX export
	  package (vs. the nuttx/ source tree) (2014-9-4).
	* apps/tools/mkimport.sh and apps/import/Makefile: Add .config file to
	  export package (2014-9-5).
	* apps/Makefile: Add a 'make import' target.  More is needed before
	  it will be usable (2014-9-5).
	* apps/import/Make.defs and .gitignore: Added mostly empty Make.defs
	  file.  Something like this will be bee needed for the 'make import'
	  build (2014-9-5).
	* apps/Makefile, examples/elf/Kconfig, and import/Make.defs: Copy more
	  logic from nuttx/tools/Config.mk into the Make.defs file (2014-9-5).
	* apps/import/Make.defs: Also need to define CFLAGS (2015-9-5)
	* apps/import/scripts/gnu-elf.ld:  Add GCC linker script for ELF
	  import builds (2014-9-5).
	* All Makefiles:  Add an install target to all makefiles.  For the
	  import build, the top-level Makefile now does two passes: (1) builds
	  libapp.a, then (2) installs the programs (not yet finished) (2014-9-6).
	* Many files:  With kernel build (CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL), entry point to
	  all tasks is main, not some xyz_main (2014-9-6).
	* Many Makefiles: Add program installation for CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL in
	  all Makefiles that build a main() (2014-9-6).
	* Many Makefiles.  For kernel build, the object file containing main
	  cannot go into library because of name collisions.  The object file
	  must be handled as a special case in every Makefile (2014-9-7).
	* apps/import/Make.defs: libapps.a needs to be added to the list of
	  libraries to link against (2014-9-7).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh.h and nsh_ddcmd.c: Several commands must be disabled
	  in the kernel build because they depend on interfaces that are not
	  available outside of the kernel: dd, df, losetup, mkfatfs, mkdr, and
	  ps (2014-9-7).
	* apps/import/Make.defs: ELF build requires -fno-common in CFLAGS
	  (2014-9-8).
	* apps/tools/mkromfsimg.sh:  Add a script to create a BOOT ROMFS
	  filesystem image (2014-9-9).
	* Many makefiles:  All makefiles that have separated the MAINOBJ
	  need to include MAINOBJ in list of C objects to be compiled.
	  SourceForge tick #31 from Aton (2014-9-11).
	* apps/examples/elf/tests/Makefile and nxflat/tests/Makefile: Do
	  not build test cases that use task_create if there is an address
	  environment (2014-9-14).
	* apps/examples/null/null_main.c:  Need to include config.h it order know
	  if this is or is not a kernel build (2014-9-16).
	* Change all occurrences of NxConsole to NxTerm (2014-9-20).
	* apps/examples/Konfig, Makefile, README.txt and all of mdrwb/: Add an
	  example to test MTD R/W buffering (2014-9-25).
	* apps/examples/ostest:  Add a trivial test of sem_timedwait (2014-9-16).

7.6 2014-11-26 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/ostest:  Add a simple test of named semaphores
	  (2014-9-23).
	* apps/netutils/webclient/Kconfig and webclient.c: Add implementation of
	  timeouts for the apps/netutils/webclient.  From Brennan Ashton
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig and nsh_romfsetc.c: Add support for a custom NSH
	  ROMFS startup image header file location.  From Martin Lederhilger
	  (2014-9-30).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_fscmds.c:  Fix ls -l output for regular files (14-9-30).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_ddcmd.c: Fix reversed in/out file closing when an
	  error occurs.  From Ken Pettit (2014-10-2).
	* apps/examples/ostest/aio.c, Kconfig, Makefile, and ostest_main.c: Add
	  AIO test case in OS test (2014-10-5).
	* apps/examples and system:  Remove non-portable uses of syslog
	  (014-10-8).
	* apps/: Correct everything under apps to use the corrected syslog
	  interfaces (2014-10-8).
	* apps/netutils/netlib/netlib_gethostaddr.c: Fix memcpy of host address
	  in netlib_gethostaddr().  From Brennan Ashton (2014-10-17).
	* apps/system/stackmonitor.c and stackmonitor/Makefile: Fix compile
	  problems introduced when the syslog() prototype changed; Also update
	  Makefile for kernel build From Radoslaw Adamczyk (2014-10-23).
	* apps/examples/nxterm/Makefile: Update makefile for kernel-build
	  issues. From Radoslaw Adamczyk (2014-10-23).
	* apps/examples/keypadtest/keypadtest_main.c: Fixes to keypadtest from
	  Pierre-Noel Bouteville (2014-10-23).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_parse.c, nsh.h, and Kconfig: Move CONFIG_NSH_TMPDIR
	  to CONFIG_LIBC_TMPDIR (2014-11-05).
	* apps/interpreter/bas:  Merged in the Michael Haardt's BAS 2.4 adapted
	  for use by NuttX by Alan Carvalho de Assis.  The bas24 branch was merged
	  into the master branch on this date (2014-11-7).
	* apps/examples/bastest:  This is a special version of Michael
	  Haardt's BAS 2.4 test files adapted for use by NuttX on a ROMFS file
	  system (2014-11-7).
	* apps/interpreter/bas: Add VT100 support for color command (2014-11-10).
	* nshlib/: Remove use of CONFIG_MAX_TASKS in ps command and in range
	  checkout (2014-11-13).
	* netutils/thttpd:  Remove use of CONFIG_MAX_TASKS in in 'task' CGI
	  example (2014-11-13).
	* sysm/i2c: Remove use of CONFIG_MAX_TASKS for maximum argument I2C
	  tool size (2014-11-13).
	* apps/netutils/dnsclient/dns_socket.c:  Right now if you make a DNS
	  request before the dns address it set you will get an assertion. The
	  state of the IP setting is not something the application should be
	  aware of, it should only be concerned with whether or not the name
	  was resolved.  From Brennan Ashton (2014-11-13).
	* apps/nshlib/, apps/netutils, and apps/include/netutils:  Misc
	  changes to support multiple networks with different link layers.  For
	  example, ETHERNET + SLIP (2014-11-15).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_usbconsole.c:  Add logic to restart the console wait
	  if an error occurs while reading from the console.In USB console
	  startup, the logic must be able to open the USB serial and receive 3
	  newlines.  However, it the USB driver is disconnected or otherwise
	  fails before the 3 newlines are received, the receive loop becomes a
	  killer, infinite loop, CPU hog.  Noted by spasbyspas (2014-11-16).
	* examples/, netutils/, nshlib/, various files:  Rename
	  CONFIG_NET_BUFSIZE to CONFIG_NET_ETH_MTU; Add CONFIG_NET_SLIP_MTU.
	  Modify logic to handle different MTUs when both Ethernet and SLIP
	  are enabled (2014-11-16).
	* apps/examples/discover, tcpecho, webserver, xmlrpc:  These examples
	  all set the IP address of eth1 but the netmask and gateway of eth0
	  if DHCP is enabled.  That can't be right???? (2014-11-17).
	* apps/examples/bridge:  Add a simple UDP relay bridge for testing
	  configurations with multiple networks.  Initial checkin is not
	  very usuable because it lacks a host-side test driver for the
	  bridge (2014-11-17).
	* apps/netutils/codecs/md5.c: Fix md5 hashing when digest[$i] lower
	  that 16. From Sergey (2015-11-20).
	* apps/examples/bridge/host_main.c, host_net1.c, host_net2.c, Kconfig,
	  and Makefile:  Add host-side test driver (2014-11-21).

7.7 2015-01-26 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/romfs/Makefile: fix romfs example builtin app registry
	  issue.  From Librae (2014-11-27).
	* apps/examples/djoystick and support files:  Add a test of the discrete
	  joystick driver (2014-11-28).
	* apps/examples/ajoystick and support files:  Add a test of the analog
	  joystick driver (2014-12-03).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c: NSH TFTP get command:  Wrong file namei
	  used for the destination.  From Lazlo (2014-12-10).
	* apps/system/cu: Add a minimalist implementation  of the 'cu' terminal
	  program (part of Taylor UUCP for ages). Using it, you can simply open
	  a serial port and interact with it. Using '~.' you can leave the
	  terminal program and drop back to nsh.  This  might come in handy for
	  people that have e.g. GSM modems, GPS receivers or other devices with
	  text based serial communications attached to their Nuttx systems. From
	  Harald Welte (2014-12-13).
	* apps/examples/ltdc and build-related file: Add ltdc test example. From
	  Marco Krahl (2014-12-19).
	* apps/system/cdcacm, composite and usbmsc:  Fix some strangely placed
	  conditional compilation.  Looks like an automated update gone awry
	  (2014-12-28).
	* apps/examples/ltdc/ltdc_main.c:  Clean up documentation, some formatting
	  improvements.  From Marco Krahl (2014-12-29).
	* apps/system/lm75 and build-related files:  Add a tiny application to
	  read the temperature from an LM-75 (or compatible) temperature sensor
	  (2015-01-06).
	* apps/interpreters/micropython:  A port of Micro Python to NuttX.
	  Contributed by Dave Marples (2015-01-11).
	* apps/examples/timer:  Add a trivial test of the timer driver
	  (2015-01-13).
	* apps/netutils/dnsclient:  Can select to be either IPv4 or IPv6, but
	  not both (IPv6 still does not compile) (2015-01-18).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  Add new library functions to manipulate IPv6
	  addresses (2015-01-13).
	* apps/nshlib/Kconfig and nsh_netinit.c:  Add logic to initialize
	  IPv6 addresses (2015-01-19).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  All IOCTLs must use a valid address family --
	  even if the address family does not matter such as when getting the
	  MAC address or the network flags (2015-01-19).
	* apps/examples/nettest:  Update test so that it can be used to test
	  IPv6 TCP sockets (2015-01-20).
	* Many files: Correct name of fields in struct sockaddr_in6:  sin6_port
	  and sin6_family, not sin_port and sin_family (2015-01-20).
	* apps/netutils/telnetd:  Add protection when CONFIG_SCHED_HAVE_PARENT
	  is enabled:  Call sigaction with SA_NOCLDWAIT so that exit status is
	  not retained (no zombies) and block receipt of SIGCHLD so that accept
	  is not awakened by a signal.  If accept() is awakened by a signal, do
	  not do anything crazy like exit.  Most from Rony Xln (2015-01-22).
	*  apps/examples/udp:  The UDP test example has been extend to support
	  IPv6 domain sockets (2015-01-22).
	* apps/nshlib:  Add the ping6 command to support checking IPv6 networks.
	  (2015-01-23).
	* apps/nsh: Clean up network status presentation for IPv6 (2015-01-24).

7.8 2015-02-11 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/interpreters/micropython: Add math library defines for nan(),
	  copysign(), and trunc() functions.  From Brennan Ashton (2015-01-26).
	* apps/examples/ustream:  Add a simple test of Unix domain sockets
	  (2015-01-27).
	* apps/examples/udgram:  Add a simple test of Unix domain datagram
	  sockets (2015-01-28)
	* apps/Makefile and builtin/Makefile: Fix for building with parallel
	  make. Build-server sometimes failed 'make -j24' with errors in the
	  builtin line or or sometimes silently succeeds but generated builds
	  that contain a random subset of configured NuttX applications. There
	  are two root causes for this: (1) Recipes for building builtin_list.h
	  and builtin_proto.h are not linearizable, and (2) Nothing ensures
	  that 'make context' is run first for apps/builtin.  This change
	  address both issues. From Juha Niskanen (2015-02-03).
	* apps/netutils/netlib:  Add utilities to convert to/from prefix lengths
	  from/to 128-bit network masks (2015-02-06).
	* apps/nshlib: Modify the NSH IPv6 ifconfig command to show the more
	  standard post-pended prefix value, rather than the full 128-bit netmask
	  (2015-02-06).

7.9 2015-04-14 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/examples/ostest: Improved error checking for sem_timedwait()
	  from Juha Niskanen (2015-02-20).
	* apps/netutils/Kconfig, Make.defs, and pppd/: Add a PPP daemon.  From
	  Max Neklyudov (2015-03-11).
	* Rename arch_nshinitialize() to board_app_initialize() (2015-03-30).
	* apps/nshlib:  NSH initialization now calls boardctl(BOARDIOC_INIT)
	  instead of board_app_initaliaze().   Remove support for
	  CONFIG_NSH_ARCHMAC.  It is not used and there are better ways to do
	  that operation (2015-03-31).
	* apps/examples/touchscreen:  No longer calls arch_tcinitialize() or
	  arch_tcuninitialize().  Instead the new OS interface boardctl() is
	  called to perform these test operations on the touchscreen driver
	  (2015-03-31).
	* apps/examples/adc: Change apps/examples/adc to that is now calls
	  boardctl() instead of adc_devinit() in order to initalize the ADC
	  device(2015-03-31).
	* apps/examples/pwm/: Replace calls to pwm_devinit() in
	  apps/examples/pwm with calls to boardctl() (2015-03-31).
	* apps/examples/:  More renaming: up_lcdinitialize->board_lcd_initialize,
	  up_lcdgetdev->board_lcd_getdev, up_lcduninitialize->board_lcd_uninitialize
	  (2015-04-04).
	* apps/examples/nxlines/: Add the new 'capped' parameter to nx_drawline()
	  calls (2015-04-05).
	* apps/modbus/tcp:  Fix some complile problems when TCP is enabled
	  (2015-04-06).
	* apps/system: Clean up Kconfig menus.  The way it worked before, it was
	  difficult to see what was enabled and what was not.  menus replaced
	  with menuconfig (2015-04-07).
	* apps/examples/ostest/sigprocmask.c: Add a simple test of sigprocmask,
	  sighold, and sigrelse (2015-04-09).
	* apps/modbus: Includes extensions to support RTU master mode by
	  Armink(383016632@qq.com):
	  https://github.com/armink/FreeModbus_Slave-Master-RTT-STM32.  Ported
	  to NuttX by Darcy Gong.
	* apps/nshlib:  Allow NSH 'date' command with no hardware RTC.  Thisi
	  command is useful without an RTC too.  Also, this permits testing on
	  the simulator which never has an RTC (2015-04-11).
	* apps/netutils/ppp: Make pppd PAP authentication optional.  From
	  Brennan Ashton
	* apps/examples/pppd:  Add PPPD test case.  Split out from
	  apps/netutils/pppd by Brennan Ashton.
	* apps/netutils/pppd: Spit up pppd utils.  From Brennan Ashton.
	* apps/system/zoneinfo:  All logic to build timezone info.  Does not do
	  much else yet (2015-04-14).

7.10 2015-06-09 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/system/zoneinfo:  Add logic to build a ROMFS file system
	  containing the timezone data (2015-04-15).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_timcmds.c: Check return values from time functions
	  (2015-04-15).
	* apps/examples/nxlines:  Fix missing right bracket that causes
	  compile error when CONFIG_NX_XYINPUT=y.  From Librae (2015-04-16).
	* apps/examples: When boardctl() fails, need to print errno not the
	  returned value which will always be -1 (2015-04-16).
	* apps/examples: Correct use of the BOARDIOC_GRAPHICS_SETUP boardctl()
	  call (2015-04-16).
	* apps/examples/ltdc:  Add testing support for the STM32 LTDC's 2D
	  DMA. From Marco Krahl (2015-04-16).
	* apps/nshlib/: Fix handling of gmtime_r return value in time commands.
	  gmtime_r returns a pointer, not an int (2015-04-21).
	* apps/netutils/ntp: Fix mismatched sched_lock/unlock.  Noted by
	  Juha Niskanen (2015-05-06).
	* apps/examples:  Modify/simpify apps/examples build files.  From Roman
	  Saveljev (2015-05-06).
	* apps/nshlib/nsh_netinit.c and apps/examples/ustream/: Add poll
	  support for Unix stream sockets.  From Jussi Kivilinna (2015-05-12).
	* apps/examples/ostest: Add a test of nested signals.  There are no
	  failures to handle signals but neither am I getting any nested
	  signal handling (2015-05-12).
	* apps/nshlib: Enhancements to NSH ifconfig for case of multi-link
	  operation, TUN device and local connections.  From Max Neklyudov
	  (2015-05-19).
	* apps/nshlib: Enhanced output to NSH ping command from Max Neklyudov
	  (2015-05-27).
	* apps/examples/elf: Add configuration options to support building the
	  hello++4 example that depends upon having uClibc++ available.  From
	  Leo aloe3132 (2015-05-29).
	* apps/platform/stm32f4discovery: Move up_cxxinitialize from
	  nuttx/configs/stm32f4discovery/src to apps/platform/stm32f4discovery
	  where it belongs (2015-05-29).
	* apps/examples/elf/tests/helloxx: Add hello++5 to ELF example.  From
	  Leo Aloe3132 (2015-06-01).
	* apps/netutils/thttpd/ and apps/examples/thttpd/: Add support for using
	  binfs/ instead of NXFLAT.  NXFLAT is probably the better solution but
	  recently compiler changes make it unusable.  binfs or ELF are fallback
	  binary formats.  This commit adds an option to use binfs (2015-06-02).
	* apps/examples/unionfs: Add a test of the union file system to
	  apps/examples (2015-06-05).
	* apps/examples/thttpd now uses the Union File System if BINFS is
	  selected for CGI binaries (2015-06-06).
	* apps/nshlib/: The NSH mount command now recognizes the Union file
	  system type when listing mounted file systems (2015-06-07).

7.11 2015-xx-xx Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* apps/netutils/thttpd:  Fix compilation problems when
	  CONFIG_THTTPD_GENERATE_INDICES is defined (2015-06-12).
	* apps/include: Clean up and review of header files for conformance to
	  standards (2015-06-12).
	* apps/examples/ostest/:  Extend the OS test to include a test of
	  pthread_mutex_trylock() for recursive mutexes. From Juha Niskanen
	  (2015-06-16).
	* apps/netutils/thttpd: Missing gci-src as a dependency path when
	  building with BINFS enabled (2015-06-18).
