	---help---
		This testing/benchmark application performs an erase/write
		operation to evaluate write transfer rate and then reads the
		written content back to evaluate the read transfer rate. Finally,
		it compares the read data with the previously written data to
		ensure the MTD device is working as expected.

		NOTE:  This application uses internal OS interfaces and so it is not
		available in the NuttX kernel build.
