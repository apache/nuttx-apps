menuconfig BOOT_NXBOOT
	bool "NuttX bootloader"
	default n
	select BCH
	---help---
		Enable support for the minimal NuttX based bootloader.

if BOOT_NXBOOT

config NXBOOT_PRIMARY_SLOT_PATH
	string "Application firmware primary image slot path"
	default "/dev/ota0"
	---help---
		The path to the application firmware image primary slot character
		device driver. The image runs from this location.
		Default: /dev/ota0

config NXBOOT_SECONDARY_SLOT_PATH
	string "Application firmware secondary image slot path"
	default "/dev/ota1"
	---help---
		The path to the application firmware image primary slot character
		device driver. This is either update or recovery slot.
		Default: /dev/ota1

config NXBOOT_TERTIARY_SLOT_PATH
	string "Application firmware tertiary image slot path"
	default "/dev/ota2"
	---help---
		The path to the application firmware image primary slot character
		device driver. This is either update or recovery slot.
		Default: /dev/ota2

config NXBOOT_HEADER_SIZE
	hex "Application firmware image header size"
	default 0x200
	---help---
		Note that this size should be aligned with the program memory write
		page size!

config NXBOOT_BOOTLOADER
	bool "Build nxboot bootloader application"
	default n
	select BOARDCTL
	select BOARDCTL_BOOT_IMAGE
	---help---
		This option builds and links a bootloader application. This application
		should be an entry function for NuttX. It checks for possible update/
		revert operation, performs it and boot the correct image.

if NXBOOT_BOOTLOADER

config NXBOOT_SWRESET_ONLY
	bool "Perform update/revert only on SW reset"
	default n
	select BOARDCTL_RESET_CAUSE
	---help---
		This option ensures the update/revert is performed only for following
		reset causes:
			BOARDIOC_RESETCAUSE_CPU_SOFT: software reset
			BOARDIOC_RESETCAUSE_CPU_RWDT: watchdog error
			BOARDIOC_RESETCAUSE_PIN: reset button

		This way the board can keep its image (even if not confirmed) during
		for example power shutdown and perform update/revent only if expected
		based on user/maintainer input.

config NXBOOT_PREVENT_DOWNGRADE
	bool "Perform update only for newer version"
	default n
	---help---
		NXboot uses Semantic Version 2.0.0 (without build metadata). By default
		the update is performed for every version that doesn't match the
		currently running one. If NXBOOT_PREVENT_DOWNGRADE selected, update is
		performed only for newer versions  (according to Semantic Version
		preference rules).

		WARNING: NXboot currently implementes preferences only for
		MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH and ignores prerelease.
