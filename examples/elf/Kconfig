config EXAMPLES_ELF
	bool "ELF Loader Example"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable the ELF loader example

if EXAMPLES_ELF

config EXAMPLES_ELF_SYSCALL
	bool "Link with SYSCALL library"
	default n
	depends on LIB_SYSCALL && !BUILD_KERNEL
	---help---
		Link with the SYSCALL library.  By default, all undefined symbols
		must be provided via a symbol table.  But if this option is
		selected, then each ELF test program will link with the SYSCALL
		library and will interface with the OS system calls.  In this case,
		those symbols will not be undefined.  If the SYSCALL library is
		available then you probably will want to select this option.

config EXAMPLES_ELF_LIBC
	bool "Link with LIBC"
	default n
	depends on !BUILD_KERNEL
	---help---
		Link with the C library (and also math library if it was built).
		By default, all undefined symbols must be provided via a symbol
		table.  But if this option is selected, then each ELF test program
		will link with the SYSCALL library and will interface with the OS
		system calls.  You probably will NOT want this option, however,
		because it will substantially increase the size of code.  For
		example, a separate copy of printf() would be linked with every
		program greatly increasing the total code size.  This option is
		primarily intended only for testing.

config EXAMPLES_ELF_DEVMINOR
	int "ROMFS Minor Device Number"
	default 0
	---help---
		The minor device number of the ROMFS block. For example, the N in /dev/ramN.
		Used for registering the RAM block driver that will hold the ROMFS file system
		containing the ELF executables to be tested.  Default: 0

config EXAMPLES_ELF_DEVPATH
	string "ROMFS Device Path"
	default "/dev/ram0"
	---help---
		The path to the ROMFS block driver device.  This must match EXAMPLES_ELF_DEVMINOR.
		Used for registering the RAM block driver that will hold the ROMFS file system
		containing the ELF executables to be tested.  Default: "/dev/ram0"

config EXAMPLES_ELF_CXXINITIALIZE
	bool "C++ Initialization"
	default y
	depends on HAVE_CXX && HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE
	---help---
		By default, if CONFIG_HAVE_CXX and CONFIG_HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE are
		defined, then this example will call the NuttX function to
		initialize static C++ constructors.  This option may be disabled,
		however, if that static initialization was performed elsewhere.

config EXAMPLES_ELF_UCLIBCXX
	bool "uClibc++ is installed"
	default n
	depends on UCLIBCXX
	---help---
		By default, uClibc++ is not installed and configured. If the
		user installs and configures the C++ standard library, this
		example will compile the demos using it.
