		This logic performs a SMART flash block device test.  This test
		performs a sector allocate, read, write, free and garbage collection
		test on a SMART MTD block device.  This test can be built only as an
		NSH command

		NOTE:  This test uses internal OS interfaces and so is not available
		in the NUTTX kernel build
