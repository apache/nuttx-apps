config EXAMPLES_FLOWC
	bool "Serial flow control example"
	default n
	depends on SERIAL_TERMIOS
	---help---
		Enable the serial hardware flow control test.

		Serial termios support must be enabled.

			CONFIG_SERIAL_TERMIOS=y

		In addtion, you will need these related serial driver settings (the
		actual values of the watermark setting may be tuned to suit your
		preferences)

			CONFIG_SERIAL_IFLOWCONTROL=y
			CONFIG_SERIAL_IFLOWCONTROL_WATERMARKS=y
			CONFIG_SERIAL_IFLOWCONTROL_LOWER_WATERMARK=25
			CONFIG_SERIAL_IFLOWCONTROL_UPPER_WATERMARK=75

		And for the CDC/ACM driver in particular:

			CONFIG_CDCACM_IFLOWCONTROL=y

		There are hooks in place for output flow control but these have not
		been exercised.

config EXAMPLES_FLOWC_SENDER1
	bool "Target1 is the sender"
	default n
	---help---
		By default Target1 is the receiver and the host PC (or Target2) is
		the sender.  That is the configuration you would to test RX flow
		control on the target.

		This is the name of the Target1 program that will be use when the
		NSH ELF program is installed.

config EXAMPLES_FLOWC_TARGET2
	bool "Second endpoint is a target"
	default n
	---help---
		By default, the host PC is configured as the second endpoint of the
		FLOWC test.  If this option is selected, then the second endpoint
		will be built into the FLASH image as well.  This means that you
		can use two target boards to run the test with no host PC
		involvement.
