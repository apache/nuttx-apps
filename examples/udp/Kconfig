		Selecting this option will enable logic in the example to perform

		want to do this if the example is running stand-alone.  If the
		example is running as an NSH command, then the network as already
		been initialized.

		This basic initialization currently only supports basic
		initialization of Ethernet network devices.  For other exotic
		network devices this initialization should be suppressed.  Such
		devices will require other, external initialization.
