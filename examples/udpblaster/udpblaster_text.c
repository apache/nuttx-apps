  "ONE day Henny-penny was picking up corn in the cornyard when--whack!--"
  "something hit her upon the head. 'Goodness gracious me!' said Henny-"
  "penny; 'the sky's a-going to fall; I must go and tell the king.'\n\n"

  "So she went along and she went along and she went along till she met "
  "Cocky-locky. 'Where are you going, Hennypenny?' says Cocky-locky. 'Oh! "
  "I'm going to tell the king the sky's a-falling,' says Henny-penny. 'May "
  "I come with you?' says Cocky-locky. 'Certainly,' says Henny-penny. So "
  "Hennypenny and Cocky-locky went to tell the king the sky was falling.\n\n"

  "They went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they "
  "met Ducky-daddles. 'Where are you going to, Hennypenny and Cocky-locky?' "
  "says Ducky-daddles. 'Oh! we're going to tell the king the sky's a-"
  "falling,' said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky. 'May I come with you?' said "
  "Ducky-daddles. 'Certainly,' said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky. So "
  "Hennypenny, Cocky-locky, and Ducky-daddles went to tell the king the sky "
  "was a-falling.\n\n"

  "So they went along and they went along, and they went along, till they "
  "met Goosey-poosey. 'Where are you going to, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,"
  "and Ducky-daddles?' said Gooseypoosey. 'Oh! we're going to tell the king "
  "the sky's a-falling,' said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky and Ducky-"
  "daddles. 'May I come with you?' said Goosey-poosey. 'Certainly,' said "
  "Hennypenny, Cocky-locky, and Ducky-daddles. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, "
  "Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey went to tell the king the sky was a-"
  "falling.\n\n"

  "So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they "
  "met Turkey-lurkey. 'Where are you going, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-"
  "daddles, and Gooseypoosey?' says Turkey-turkey. 'Oh! we're going to tell "
  "the king the sky's a-falling,' said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, "
  "Duckydaddies, and Goosey-poosey. 'May I come with you, Hennypenny, "
  "Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey?' said Turkey-lurkey. 'Oh, "
  " certainly, Turkey-turkey,' said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, "
  "Ducky-daddles, and Gooseypoosey. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-"
  "daddles,Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey all went to tell the king "
  "the sky was a-falling.\n\n"

  "So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they "
  "met Foxy-woxy, and Foxy-woxy said to Hennypenny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-"
  "daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey: 'Where are you going, Henny-"
  "penny, Cockylocky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey?' And "
  "Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey poosey, and Turkey- "
  "lurkey said to Foxy-woxy: 'We' re going to tell the king the sky's a "
  "-falling.' 'Oh! butthis is not the way to the king, Henny-penny, Cocky- "
  "locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey,' says Foxy-woxy; "
  "'I know the proper way; shall I show it you?' 'Oh, certainly, Foxywoxy,'"
  "said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and "
  "Turkey-lurkey. So Henny-penny, Cockylocky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, "
  "Turkey-lurkey, and Foxy-woxy all went to tell the king the sky was a-"
  "falling. So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, "
  "till they came to a narrow and dark hole. Now this was the door of Foxy-"
  "woxy's cave. But Foxy-woxy said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, "
  "Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkeyturkey: 'This is the short way "
  "to the king's palace: you'll soon get there if you follow me. I will go "
  "first and you come after, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, "
  "Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-turkey.' 'Why, of course, certainly, without "
  "doubt, why not?' said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-"
  "poosey, and Turkey-lurkey.\n\n"

  "So Foxy-woxy went into his cave, and he didn't go very far, but turned "
  "round to wait for Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-"
  "poosey, and Turkey-lurkey. So at last at first Turkey-lurkey went "
  "through the dark hole into the cave. He hadn't got far when 'Hrumph', "
  "Foxy-woxy snapped off Turkey-lurkey's head and threw his body over his "
  "left shoulder. Then Goosey-poosey went in, and 'Hrumph', off went her "
  "head and Goosey-poosey was thrown beside Turkey-lurkey. Then Ducky-"
  "daddles waddled down, and 'Hrumph', snapped Foxy-woxy, and Ducky-"
  "daddles's head was off and Duckydaddies was thrown alongside Turkey-"
  "turkey and Gooseypoosey. Then Cocky-locky strutted down into the cave, "
  "and he hadn't gone far when 'Snap, Hrumph!' went Foxy-woxy, and Cocky-"
  "locky was thrown alongside of Turkey-lurkey, Gooseypoosey, and Ducky-"
  "daddles.\n\n"

  "But Foxy-woxy had made two bites at Cocky-locky, and when the first snap "
  "only hurt Cocky-locky, but didn't kill him, he called out to Henny- "
  "penny. But she turned tail and off she ran home, so she never told the "
  "king the sky was a-falling.\n\n";
