config GAMES_BRICKMATCH
	bool "Brickmatch Game"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable Brickmatch games. Brickmatch is like a mix
		between Tetris and Crush Candy. The inspiration came
		from a Shift game that was available for Android in the
		F-Droid store. The original game source code still here:
		https://github.com/boombuler/Shift/ but the game only works
		for old Android versions (4.x).
		NOTE: The source code here is not based on that code from
		above github.
