  Title:        LARGE BITMAP SUPPORT
  Description:  In CImage, m_origin.x and .y need to be allowed to go
                negative so that you can pan through a large image.

  Title:        GLYPH BACKGROUNDS
  Description:  For most glyphs, background could is set to the currently
                selected background color.  An option should be to set the
                background of glyphs (only) to transparent.

  Title:        MESSAGE BOX
  Description:  Need the moral equivalent of a Windows message box:  A
                simple, model window that provides a message a button to
                dismiss the message.  This would be helpful, for example,
                to handle behaviors on errors instead of just failing
                quietly.

  Priority:    Medium.  That is big functional limitation.

  Title:       BUGS WHEN CANNOT READ FROM LCD
  Description: There is a kludge in the code to handle the case where we cannot
               read the background data because the LCD does not support read
               operations.  You cannot read from the STM3240G-EVAL LCD right
               now (it might be possible, but I have not figured out how yet).

               In that case, we just use the default background color.  However,
               that doesn't work either for the case where the background color
               changes when the widget is selected.  Then the background color
               in the font is wrong.  There is a hack in in CButtonArrary that
               fixed this problem, but the problem certainly exists in other
               places as well and begs for a better solution.
