   * Unicode string class.  Uses 16-bt wide-character encoding.  For optimal
   * performance, use the CStringIterator class to iterate over a CNxString
   * instance.
   *
   * Where possible, the string avoids allocating memory each time the
   * string grows or shrinks.  This means that the string may consume more
   * memory than the number of chars would seem to dictate if the object
   * previously contained a large string that has subsequently been truncated.
   * It also means that increasing the length of such a string is a cheaper
   * operation as memory does not need to allocated and copied.
   *
   * Additionally, the string increases its array size by m_growAmount every
   * time it needs to allocate extra memory, potentially reducing the number
   * of reallocs needed.
   *
   * The string is not null-terminated.  Instead, it uses a m_stringLength
   * member that stores the number of characters in the string.  This saves a
   * byte and makes calls to getLength() run in O(1) time instead of O(n).
