/* This module defines the interface for the application. It contains
 * the basic functions and types required to use the Modbus protocol stack.
 * A typical application will want to call eMBInit() first. If the device
 * is ready to answer network requests it must then call eMBEnable() to activate
 * the protocol stack. In the main loop the function eMBPoll() must be called
 * periodically. The time interval between pooling depends on the configured
 * Modbus timeout. If an RTOS is available a separate task should be created
 * and the task should always call the function eMBPoll().

 * processed until eMBEnable() has been called.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   eMode If ASCII or RTU mode should be used.
 *   ucSlaveAddress The slave address. Only frames sent to this
 *     address or to the broadcast address are processed.
 *   ucPort The port to use. E.g. 1 for COM1 on windows. This value

 *   eParity Parity used for serial transmission.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If no error occurs the function returns eMBErrorCode::MB_ENOERR.
 *   The protocol is then in the disabled state and ready for activation
