 * Reference:
 *
 *   This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 *   The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
 *   written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 *
 *   This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
 *
 *   Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
 *   This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 *   except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 *   with every copy.
 *
 *   To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
 *   md5_context_s structure, pass it to md5_init, call md5_update as
 *   needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call md5_final, which
 *   will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.
 *
 *   See README and COPYING for more details.
