 * If this flag is set, webclient_perform() returns -EAGAIN

/* wget calls a user provided function of the following type to process

 * system, then it may just write the data to a file.  Or it may buffer the
 * file in memory.  To facilitate this latter case, the caller may modify
 * the buffer address in this callback by writing to buffer and buflen. This
 * may be used, for example, to implement double buffering.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   buffer - A pointer to a pointer to a buffer.  If the callee wishes to
 *       change the buffer address, it may do so in the callback by writing
 *       to buffer.
 *   offset - Offset to the beginning of valid data in the buffer.  Offset
 *       is used to skip over any HTTP header info that may be at the
 *       beginning of the buffer.
 *   datend - The end+1 offset of valid data in the buffer.  The total number
 *       of valid bytes is datend - offset.
 *   buflen - A pointer to the length of the buffer.  If the callee wishes
 *       to change the size of the buffer, it may write to buflen.
 *   arg    - User argument passed to callback.
 *
 * Note: changing buffer address and/or size is only allowed for HTTP 1.0.
 * It's not allowed for HTTP 1.1.

/* webclient_body_callback_t: a callback to provide request body
 *
 * This callback can be called multiple times to provide
 * webclient_context::bodylen bytes of the data.
 * It's the responsibility of this callback to maintain the current
 * "offset" of the data. (similarly to fread(3))
 *
 * An implementation of this callback should perform either of
 * the followings:
 *
 * - Fill the buffer (specified by buffer and *sizep) with the data
 *
 * - Update *datap with a buffer filled with the data. In this case,
 *   it can return more than the amount specified *sizep.
 *
 * Either ways, it should update *sizep to the size of the data.
 *
 * A short result is allowed. In that case, this callback will be called
 * again to provide the remaining data.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   buffer  - The buffer to fill.
 *   sizep   - The size of buffer/data in bytes.
 *   datap   - The data to return.
 *   reqsize - The requested size.
 *             Note: This can be larger than *sizep.
 *             The callback can choose either of:
 *               * return more than *sizep data by updating *datap
 *                 with a large enough buffer
 *               * or, just return up to *sizep. (For the rest of data,
 *                 the callback will be called again later.)
 *   ctx     - The value of webclient_context::body_callback_arg.
