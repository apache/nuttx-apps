/* Old distributions of the NCSA and Apache web servers included a
 * version of the phf program that had a bug.  The program could
 * easily be made to run arbitrary shell commands.  There is no real
 * legitimate use for phf, so any attempts to run it must be considered
 * to be attacks.  Accordingly, this version of phf logs the attack
 * on stderr and then returns a page on CONFIG_THTTPD_CGI_OUTFD indicating
 * that phf doesn't exist.
