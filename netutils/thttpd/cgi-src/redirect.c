/* Three steps to set up a redirection:
 *
 *  1. Make sure your web server is set up to allow CGI programs.
 *  2. Make a symbolic link from the file you want to redirect,
 *     pointing at this program in the CGI bin directory.
 *  3. Add an entry to the file ".redirects" in the directory where your
 *     http server runs CGI programs.  For most servers, this is the
 *     directory where the given CGI program lives.  The format of the
 *     file is a bunch of lines with a filename, whitespace, and the new
 *     URL.  For example:
 *
 *     /test/oldfile.html    http://www.acme.com/test/newfile.html
 *
 *     The easiest way to figure out precisely what filename to put into
 *     .redirects is to set up the symlink and then click on it.  You'll get
 *     back a "404 Not Found" page which includes the filename as received by
 *     the redirect program, and that's what you want to use.
 *
 * Note: this is designed for thttpd (http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/)
 * and using it with other web servers may require some hacking.  A possible
 * gotcha is with the symbolic link from the old file pointing at this
 * script - servers other than thttpd may not allow that link to be run
 * as a CGI program, because they don't check the link to see that it
 * points into the allowed CGI directory.
 *
 * Note two: It would be really cool to have this program look for
 * the .redirects file in the same directory as the file being redirected,
 * instead of in the binaries directory.  Unfortunately, this appears
 * to be impossible with the information CGI gives, plus the non-standardized
 * but widespread practice of running CGI programs in the directory where
 * the binary lives.  Perhaps CGI 1.2 will address this.
