config NETUTILS_WEBSERVER
	bool "uIP web server"
	default n
	depends on NET_TCP
	---help---
		Enable support for the uIP web server.  This tiny web server was
		from uIP 1.0, but has undergone many changes.  It is, however,
		still referred to as the "uIP" web server.

if NETUTILS_WEBSERVER

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_SINGLECONNECT
	bool "Single Connection"
	default DISABLE_PTHREAD
	---help---
		By default, the uIP web server will create a new, independent thread
		for each connection.  This can, however, use a lot of stack space
		if there are many connections and that can be a problem is RAM is
		limited.  If this option is selected, then a single thread will
		service all HTTP requests and, in this case, only a single connection
		at a time is supported at a time.

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_SCRIPT_DISABLE
	bool "Disable %! scripting"
	default NETUTILS_HTTPD_SENDFILE
	---help---
		This option, if selected, will elide the %! scripting

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_ENABLE_CHUNKED_ENCODING
	bool "Enable HTTP chunked encoding"
	default !NETUTILS_HTTPD_SCRIPT_DISABLE
	---help---
		This option, if selected, will cause transmissions of blocks of
		initially unknown size (e.g. dynamic content creation) to be sent
		using "Transfer-Encoding: chunked".

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_MAXPATH
	int "Maximum size of a path"
	default 64
	---help---
		This is the maximum size of a PATH used in the web server.  This setting
		is the logically the same as the PATH_MAX setting that (and in fact, if
		not defined, the MAX_PATH setting will be used).  This setting allows
		more conservative memory allocation.

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_CGIPATH
	bool "URL/CGI function mapping"
	default n
	---help---
		This option enables mappings from URLs to call CGI functions.  The
		effect is that the existing httpd_cgi_register() interface can be
		used thus:

		const static struct httpd_cgi_call a[] = {
			{ NULL, "/abc", cgi_abc },
			{ NULL, "/xyz", cgi_xyz }
		};

		for (i = 0; i < nitems(a); i++) {
			httpd_cgi_register(&a[i]);
		}

		Where (under NETUTILS_HTTPD_CGIPATH) the "/xyz" is a URL path,
		rather than a %! xyz style call in the existing manner.

		This is useful when NETUTILS_HTTPD_SCRIPT_DISABLE is defined.

		In other words, this provides a way to get your CGI functions called
		without needing the scripting language. I'm using this to provide a
		REST style interface over HTTP, where my CGI handlers just return a
		HTTP status code with a content length of 0.

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_ERRPATH
	string "Error Path"
	default ""
	---help---
		Path used in error return packets.

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_SERVERHEADER_DISABLE
	bool "Disabled the SERVER header"
	default n
	---help---
		This option, if selected, will elide the Server\: header

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_TIMEOUT
	int "Receive Timeout (sec)"
	default 0
	depends on NET_SOCKOPTS
	---help---
		Receive timeout setting (in seconds).  A timeout value of zero
		disables the timeout.  An HTTP 408 error is generated if the timeout
		expires.  This option depends on support for socket options (sockopts).

choice
	prompt "File Transfer Method"
	default NETUTILS_HTTPD_CLASSIC

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_CLASSIC
	bool "Pre-processed files"
	---help---
		Traditionally, the uIP-based webserver only sends "files" that have
		been prepared as a data structure using nutts/tools/mkfsdata.pl

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_MMAP
	bool "File mmap-ing"
	---help---
		Traditionally, the uIP-based webserver only sends "files" that have
		been prepared as a data structure using nutts/tools/mkfsdata.pl
		However, extensions have been contributed.  If this option is
		selected, then files can be accessed from the NuttX file system
		as well.  This selection will map the files into memory (using mmap)
		so that the logic is still basically compatible with the classic
		approach.  NOTE, however, that since files are copied into memory,
		this limits solution to small files that will fit into available RAM.

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_SENDFILE
	bool "sendfile()"
	select NETUTILS_HTTPD_SCRIPT_DISABLE
	---help---
		Traditionally, the uIP-based webserver only sends "files" that have
		been prepared as a data structure using nutts/tools/mkfsdata.pl
		However, extensions have been contributed.  If this option is
		selected, then files can be accessed from the NuttX file system
		as well.  This selection will use the NuttX sendfile() interface
		to send files.  NOTE: If this option is selected, then scripting
		must be disabled since it depends on the classic, in-memory
		representation.

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_PATH
	string "Location of the files"
	depends on NETUTILS_HTTPD_MMAP || NETUTILS_HTTPD_SENDFILE
	default "/mnt"

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_KEEPALIVE_DISABLE
	bool "Keepalive Disable"
	default y
	---help---
		Disabled HTTP keep-alive for HTTP clients.  Keep-alive permits a
		client to make multiple requests over the same connection, rather
		than closing and opening a new socket for each request.

		This depends on the content-length being known, and is automatically
		disabled for situations where that header isn't produced (i.e.
		scripting, CGI). Keep-alive is also disabled for certain error
		responses.

		Keep-alive should normally be disabled if timeouts are enabled,
		otherwise a rogue HTTP client could block the httpd indefinitely.

	bool "Show file stats"
