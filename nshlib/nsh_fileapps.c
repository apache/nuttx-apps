 * Name: nsh_fileapp
 *
 * Description:
 *    Attempt to execute the application task whose name is 'cmd'
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   <0          If posix_spawn() fails, then the negated errno value
 *               is returned.
 *   -1 (ERROR)  if the application task corresponding to 'cmd' could not
 *               be started (possibly because it doesn not exist).
 *    0 (OK)     if the application task corresponding to 'cmd' was
 *               and successfully started.  If CONFIG_SCHED_WAITPID is
 *               defined, this return value also indicates that the
 *               application returned successful status (EXIT_SUCCESS)
 *    1          If CONFIG_SCHED_WAITPID is defined, then this return value
 *               indicates that the application task was spawned successfully
 *               but returned failure exit status.
