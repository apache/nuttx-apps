menuconfig SYSTEM_CDCACM
	bool "USB CDC/ACM Device Commands"
	default n
	depends on CDCACM && !KERNEL_BUILD
	---help---
		Enable the USB CDC/ACM class controls.  These controls include:

		sercon:  Connect the mass storage device to the host
		serdis:  Disconnect the mass storage device to the host

if SYSTEM_CDCACM

config SYSTEM_CDCACM_DEVMINOR

	default 0
	---help---
		The minor device number of the serial driver for the CDC/ACM device.
		For example, N in /dev/ttyACMN.  Used for registering the serial
		driver. Default is zero.

config SYSTEM_CDCACM_TRACEINIT
	bool "USB Trace Initialization"
	default n
	depends on USBDEV_TRACE || DEBUG_USB

		If USBDEV_TRACE is enabled (or DEBUG and DEBUG_USB),
		then the add-on code will also manage the USB trace output.  The
		amount of trace output can be controlled this configuration value:
		This setting will show USB initialization events

config SYSTEM_CDCACM_TRACECLASS
	bool "USB Trace Class"
	default n
	depends on USBDEV_TRACE || DEBUG_USB
