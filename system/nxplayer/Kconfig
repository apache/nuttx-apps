config NXPLAYER_INCLUDE_PREFERRED_DEVICE
	bool "Include preferred audio device specification code"

	default y
	---help---
		Compiles in extra code to determine audio format based
		on the filename extension for known file types.

	default "/music"

		when an absolute path is not provided.  This can be
		changed at the nxplayer command line, but will default
		to this value each time nxplayer is launched.

config NXPLAYER_RECURSIVE_MEDIA_SEARCH
	bool "Perform recursive directory search for media files"
	default n
	---help---
		When enabled, this feature will add code to perform
