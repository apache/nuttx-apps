 * Name: popen
 *
 * Description:
 *   The popen() function will execute the command specified by the string
 *   command. It will create a pipe between the calling program and the
 *   executed command, and will return a pointer to a stream that can be
 *   used to either read from or write to the pipe.
 *
 *   The environment of the executed command will be as if a child process
 *   were created within the popen() call using the fork() function, and the
 *   child invoked the sh utility using the call:
 *
 *     execl(shell path, "sh", "-c", command, NULL);
 *
 *   where shell path is an unspecified pathname for the sh utility.
 *
 *   The popen() function will ensure that any streams from previous popen()
 *   calls that remain open in the parent process are closed in the new child
 *   process.
 *
 *   The mode argument to popen() is a string that specifies I/O mode:
 *
 *     - If mode is r, when the child process is started, its file descriptor
 *       STDOUT_FILENO will be the writable end of the pipe, and the file
 *       descriptor fileno(stream) in the calling process, where stream is
 *       the stream pointer returned by popen(), will be the readable end of
 *       the pipe.
 *
 *     - If mode is w, when the child process is started its file descriptor
 *       STDIN_FILENO will be the readable end of the pipe, and the file
 *       descriptor fileno(stream) in the calling process, where stream is
 *       the stream pointer returned by popen(), will be the writable end of
 *       the pipe.
 *
 *   If mode is any other value, the result is undefined.
 *
 *   After popen(), both the parent and the child process will be capable of
 *   executing independently before either terminates.
 *
 *   Pipe streams are byte-oriented.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   command
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   A non-NULLFILE stream connected to the shell instance is returned on
 *   success.  NULL is returned on any failure with the errno variable set
 *   appropriately.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: pclose
 *
 * Description:
 *   The pclose() function will close a stream that was opened by popen(),
 *   wait for the command to terminate, and return the termination status of
 *   the process that was running the command language interpreter. However,
 *   if a call caused the termination status to be unavailable to pclose(),
 *   then pclose() will return -1 with errno set to ECHILD to report this
 *   situation. This can happen if the application calls one of the following
 *   functions:
 *
 *     wait()
 *     waitpid() with a pid argument less than or equal to 0 or equal to the
 *               process ID of the command line interpreter
 *
 *   Any other function not defined in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
 *   that could do one of the above
 *
 *   In any case, pclose() will not return before the child process created
 *   by popen() has terminated.
 *
 *   If the command language interpreter cannot be executed, the child
 *   termination status returned by pclose() will be as if the command
 *   language interpreter terminated using exit(127) or _exit(127).
 *
 *   The pclose() function will not affect the termination status of any
 *   child of the calling process other than the one created by popen() for
 *   the associated stream.
 *
 *   If the argument stream to pclose() is not a pointer to a stream created
 *   by popen(), the result of pclose() is undefined.
 *
 * Description:
 *   stream - The stream reference returned by a previous call to popen()
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; otherwise -1 (ERROR) is returned and
 *   the errno variable is set appropriately.
