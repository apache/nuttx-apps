menuconfig SYSTEM_ZMODEM
	bool "Zmodem Commands"
	default n
	---help---
		This selection enables the 'sz' and 'rz' NSH commands.

		NOTE:  Hardware flow control is required on the selected device in
		order to throttle the rates of data transfer to fit within the
		allocated buffers.  This cannot be checked here in the configuration
		because the device that you use may be selected at runtime.

if SYSTEM_ZMODEM

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_PRIORITY
	int "rz/sz task priority"
	default 100

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_STACKSIZE
	int "rz/ez stack size"
	default 2048

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_DEVNAME
	string "Default Zmodem device"
	default "/dev/console"
	---help---
		The default device used by the Zmodem commands if the -d option is
		not provided on the sz or rz command line.  Default:  "/dev/console".

		NOTE:  This device *MUST* support Hardware flow control in order to
		throttle the rates of data transfer to fit within the allocated buffers.

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_RCVBUFSIZE
	int "Receive buffer size"
	default 512
	---help---
		The size of one buffer used to read data from the remote peer.  The
		total buffering capability is SYSTEM_ZMODEM_RCVBUFSIZE plus the size
		of the RX buffer in the device driver.  If you are using a serial
		driver with, say, USART0.  That that buffering capability includes
		USART0_RXBUFFERSIZE.  This total buffering capability must be
		significantly larger than SYSTEM_ZMODEM_PKTBUFSIZE (larger due
		streaming race conditions, data expansion due to escaping, and
		possible protocol overhead).

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_PKTBUFSIZE
	int "Maximum packet size"
	default 512
	---help---
		Data may be received in gulps of varying size and alignment.
		Received packets data is properly unescaped, aligned and packed
		into a packet buffer of this size.

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_SNDBUFSIZE
	int "Send buffer size"
	default 512
	---help---
		The size of one transmit buffer used for composing messages sent to
		the remote peer.

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_MOUNTPOINT
	string "Zmodem sandbox"
	default "/tmp"
	---help---
		Absolute pathes in received file names are not accepted.  This
		configuration value must be set to provide the path to the file
		storage directory (such as a mountpoint directory).

		Names of file send by the sz commond, on the other hand, must be
		absolute paths beginning with '/'.

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_FLOWC
	bool
	default n

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_IFLOW
	bool "Rx flow control"
	default n
	select SYSTEM_ZMODEM_FLOWC
	depends on SERIAL_TERMIOS
	---help---
		Enable H/W CTS flow control.

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_OFLOW
	bool "Tx flow control"
	default n
	select SYSTEM_ZMODEM_FLOWC
	depends on SERIAL_TERMIOS
	---help---
		Enable H/W RTS flow control.

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_RCVSAMPLE
	bool "Reverse channel"
	default n
	---help---
		Local sender can sample reverse channel while sending.  This means
		in particular, that Zmodem can detect if data is received from the
		remote receiver while streaming a file to the remote receiver.
		Support for such asychronous incoming data notification is needed to
		support interruption of the file transfer by the remote receiver.

		This capapability is not yet supported.  There are only incomplete
		hooks in the code now!  Enable only if you want to see the warning.

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_SENDATTN
	bool "Attn interrupt"
	default n
	---help---
		Local sender retains an attention string that will be sent to the remote receiver

		This capapability is not yet supported.  There are only incomplete
		hooks in the code now!  Enable only if you want to see the warning.

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_ALWAYSSINT
	bool "Send ZSINIT"
	default y
	---help---
		Always send ZSINIT header

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_TIMESTAMPS
	bool "File timestamps"
	default y
	depends on RTC
	---help---
		File timestamps may be supported

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_SENDATTN
	bool "Send Attn string"
	default n
	---help---
		Send attention string not yet supported

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_SENDBRAK
	bool "Can break"
	default n
	---help---
		Can not yet send BREAK

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_RESPTIME
	int "Response time"
	default 10
	---help---
		Response time for remote peer to respond to requests.

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_CONNTIME
	int "Rz startup time"
	default 30
	---help---
		When rz starts, it must wait a for the remote end to start the file
		transfer.  This may take longer than the normal response time.  This
		value may be set to tune that longer timeout value.

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_SERIALNO
	int "Serial number"
	default 0
	---help---
		Receiver serial number

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_MAXERRORS
	int "Max error"
	default 20
	---help---
		Max receive errors before canceling the transfer.

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_WRITESIZE
	int "Write size limit"
	default 0
	---help---
		Some MMC/SD drivers may fail if large transfers are attempted.
		As a bug workaround, you can set the maximum write size with
		this configuration.  The default value of 0 means no write limit.

config DEBUG_ZMODEM
	bool "Zmodem debug"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable Zmodem debug output.  This debug is unrelated to the internal
		NuttX debug option; it does not use the SYSLOG channel but, instead,
		outputs debug information on stderr.  Obviously, enabling this
		option will likely cause you all kinds of problems if you intend to
		use /dev/console to transfer files!

config SYSTEM_ZMODEM_DUMPBUFFER
	bool "Dump buffers"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_ZMODEM
	---help---
		Dump the contents of all incoming and outgoing buffers that are
		exchanged with the remote peer.
