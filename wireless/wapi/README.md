WAPI (Wireless API) provides an easy-to-use function set to configure wireless
network interfaces on a GNU/Linux system. One can think WAPI as a lightweight C
API for `iwconfig`, `wlanconfig`, `ifconfig`, and `route` commands. (But it is
not a thin wrapper for these command line tools.) It is designed to be used in
wireless heteregenous network research projects and supported by BWRC (Berkeley
Wireless Research Center) and WISERLAB (Wireless Information Systems Engineering
Research Laboratory at Özyeğin University).

For source codes, see http://github.com/vy/wapi. The most recent version of the
documentation is (hopefully) always available at http://vy.github.com/wapi.
